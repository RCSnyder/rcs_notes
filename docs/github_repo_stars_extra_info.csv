Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large language models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for building end-to-end question answering systems. Frameworks such as [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index) and [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) have made significant progress in making RAG pipelines easy to use. While these frameworks provide excellent abstractions for building advanced RAG pipelines, they do so at the cost of transparency. From a user perspective, it's not readily apparent what's going on under the hood, particularly when errors or inconsistencies arise. 

In this [EvaDB](https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb) application, we'll shed light on the inner workings of advanced RAG pipelines by examining the mechanics, limitations, and costs that often remain opaque.

This is a free, local prototyping tool for Python developers crunching data and making visualizations. It connects Jupyter, a database of your choice, and Streamlit seamlessly for you, so you can use Jupyter to prototype your data gathering and Streamlit to prototype your data visualizations.

There are two main reasons to spin up Jupyter+DB+Streamlit this way:
- You automatically get pre-loaded PyMongo or SQLAlchemy clients in your Jupyter environment, with connection URLs correctly configured to your database. You also get the same in the Streamlit app.
- It's a one-line deploy from this Github locator (`github.com/galenmarchetti/jupyter-notebook-package`), so not much else to think about in order to get started

ScratchDB is a wrapper around Clickhouse that lets you input arbitrary JSON and
perform analytical queries against it. It automatically creates tables
and columns when new data is added.

## Quickstart

#### 1. Run the server

Clone the repo:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:scratchdata/ScratchDB.git
$ cd ScratchDB
```

Start clickhouse and localstack:
``` bash
$ docker-compose up
```

In a separate terminal, start the insert service:
``` bash
$ go run . insert
```

Finally, in an additional terminal window, start the ingest service:
```bash
$ go run . ingest
```

#### 2. Insert JSON data

``` bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/data \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'X-Api-Key: local' \
    -d '{""table"":""my_table"",""data"":{""fruit"": ""apple""}}'
```

#### 3. Query

To view data in JSON format: [http://localhost:3000/query?q=select * from my_table](http://localhost:3000/query?q=select%20*%20from%20my_table)

```bash
curl -H 'X-Api-Key: local' ""http://localhost:3000/query?q=select%20*%20from%20my_table""

# Build type-safe web APIs with JavaScript, instantly
## Spec generation and LLM streaming

**Instant API** is a framework for building APIs with JavaScript that implements
**type-safety at the HTTP interface**. By doing so, it eliminates the need for
schema validation libraries entirely. Simply write a JSDoc-compliant comment
block for a function that represents your API endpoint and stop worrying about
validation, sanitization and testing for user input. The OpenAPI specification
for your API is then automatically generated in both JSON and YAML at
`localhost:8000/.well-known/openapi.json` and
`localhost:8000/.well-known/openapi.yaml`, respectively.

Additionally, Instant API comes a number of features optimized for integrations
with LLMs and chat bots:

- First class support for Server-Sent Events using `text/event-stream` makes streaming LLM responses easy
- [LLM function calling](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates) can ",Web Development,"['Building type-safe web APIs', 'Automating API generation', 'Simplifying API development']","{""Category"": ""Web Development"", ""Problems"": [""Building type-safe web APIs"", ""Automating API generation"", ""Simplifying API development""]}"

## AI-to-AI Testing for Quality Assurance

Today's AI-driven applications largely depend on Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to deliver innovative solutions. However, ensuring that they provide relevant and accurate responses in every situation is a challenge. Spelltest addresses this by simulating LLM responses using synthetic user personas and an evaluation technique to evaluate these responses automatically(but still requires human supervision).

### How it works:

#### 1. Describe your simulation in `spellforge.yaml` file:

```yaml

    project_name: ...
    
    # describe users
    users:
       ...
    
    # describe quality metrics 
    metrics:  
      ...
    
    # describe prompts of your LLM app
    prompts:    
       ...
        
    # finally describe simulations
    simulations:
       ...


```

## ⚓ Oxc

The Oxidation Compiler is creating a suite of high-performance tools for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Oxc is building a parser, linter, formatter, transpiler, minifier, resolver ... all written in Rust.

## 💡 Philosophy

This project shares the same philosophies as [Biome][biome] and [Ruff][ruff].

1. JavaScript tooling could be rewritten in a more performant language.
2. An integrated toolchain can tap into efficiencies that are not available to a disparate set of tool",Development Tools,"{'Problem 1': 'Enables developers to write high-performance JavaScript and TypeScript code using Rust.', 'Problem 2': 'Improves the performance of existing JavaScript and TypeScript projects by leveraging Rust.', 'Problem 3': 'Provides a suite of tools for optimizing and enhancing JavaScript and TypeScript applications using Rust.'}","{""Category"": ""Development Tools"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Enables developers to write high-performance JavaScript and TypeScript code using Rust."", ""Problem 2"": ""Improves the performance of existing JavaScript and TypeScript projects by leveraging Rust."", ""Problem 3"": ""Provides a suite of tools for optimizing and enhancing JavaScript and TypeScript applications using Rust.""}}"

## How it Works
* Upload a 3D model of any object in .glb format.
* Adjust the position and orientation of the model on the canvas
* Describe the scene you want to create in the text box and click generate image

## Use Cases
* Product Photography: Create product lifestyle photos in any backdrop you can imagine, without a physical photoshoot.
* Synthetic Data Generation: Generate synthetic images of an item in a variety of scenes. Useful when training object detection models.
* Previsualize Game Assets: Upload your game assets and generate level art around it to previsualize scenes.

## Overview

Simple script for chatting with ChatGPT from the command line, using the official API ([Released March 1st, 2023](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis)). It allows, after providing a valid API Key, to use ChatGPT at the maximum speed, at a fraction of the cost of a full ChatGPT Plus subscription (at least for the average user).

## How to get an API Key

Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and log-in with your OpenAI account (register if you don't have one). Click on your name initial in the top-right corner, then select *""View API keys""*. Finally click on *""Create new secret key""*. That's it.

You may also need to add a payment method, clicking on *Billing --> Payment methods*. New accounts should have some free credits, but adding a payment method may still be mandatory. For pricing, check [this page](https://openai.com/pricing).

## Installation and essential configuration

You need Python (at least version 3.10), Pip and Git installed on your system.

First update Pip (having an older version can cause",Natural Language Processing,"['Facilitating communication with ChatGPT for non-technical users', 'Enabling easier integration of ChatGPT into command line workflows', 'Providing a simple and efficient way to interact with ChatGPT from the CLI']","{""Category"": ""Natural Language Processing"", ""Problems"": [""Facilitating communication with ChatGPT for non-technical users"", ""Enabling easier integration of ChatGPT into command line workflows"", ""Providing a simple and efficient way to interact with ChatGPT from the CLI""]}"

## Overview

The evolution of cloud computing has increased the speed of innovation for many companies, whether they are building 2 and 3-tier applications, or complex microservice-based applications. Cloud native technologies like Kubernetes have made it easier to build applications that can run anywhere. At the same time, many applications have become more complex, and managing them in the cloud increasingly difficult, as companies build cloud-native applications composed of interconnected services and deploy them to multiple public clouds and their private infrastructure.

How do causes lead to effects? Can you associate the cause leading to the observed effect? Big Data opens the doors for us to be able to answer questions such as this, but before we are able to do so, we must dive into the field of Causal Inference, a field championed by Judea Pearl.
In this series of blog posts we will learn about the main ideas of Causality by working our way through “Causal Inference In ",Data Science,"{'Problem 1': 'Determining cause and effect relationships', 'Problem 2': 'Analyzing the impact of variables on outcomes', 'Problem 3': 'Identifying patterns and trends in data'}","{

This package contains Python bindings for [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org).
ØMQ is a lightweight and fast messaging implementation.

PyZMQ should work with any reasonable version of Python (≥ 3.7), as well as PyPy.
The Cython backend used by CPython supports libzmq ≥ 2.1.4 (including 3.2.x and 4.x),
but the CFFI backend used by PyPy only supports libzmq ≥ 3.2.2 (including 4.x).

For a summary of changes to pyzmq, see our
[changelog](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html).

### ØMQ 3.x, 4.x

PyZMQ fully supports the 3.x and 4.x APIs of libzmq,
developed at [zeromq/libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq).
No code to change, no flags to pass,
just build pyzmq against the latest and it should work.

PyZMQ does not support the old libzmq 2 API on PyPy.

## Documentation

See PyZMQ's Sphinx-generated
documentation [on Read the Docs](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io) for API
details, and some notes on Python and Cython development. If you want to
learn about using ØMQ in general, the excellent [ØMQ

## Welcome

The ZeroMQ lightweight messaging kernel is a library which extends the
standard socket interfaces with features traditionally provided by
specialised messaging middleware products. ZeroMQ sockets provide an
abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple messaging patterns,
message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to multiple transport
protocols and more.

## Llama 2 Everywhere (L2E)

Note: Much gratitude for all the upvotes on HN, Twitter, Reddit and other places. I'll take time this week to polish this up a bit. For the OS, please download it from the releases. The current system requirements are 512MB RAM and a x86_64 (64bit) PC. It's not very usable yet. We are working to make it better. Feel free to sponsor us if you like the idea of a useful AI OS that runs on minimal hardware. You can find me on twitter/X here: [@VulcanIgnis](https://twitter.com/VulcanIgnis) Please note that this project is built on the shoulders of giants. Find the credits at the bottom.

emitbase-core,Core system of Emitbase,https://github.com/emitbase/emitbase-core,2023-09-11T16:43:08Z,2023-10-25T23:56:38Z,TypeScript,22,0,"# Emitbase Core

Emitbase is an open-source alerts platform for developers. It allows you to connect to a database, define the logic of alerts in SQL, and specify channels for alerts (Email or [Slack](https://slack.com/)). 

## Who is it for?

Emitbase may be a good fit if you are:

- A developer wishing to create all alerts in one place.
- A developer wishing to create alerts without interfering with the business logic of your application.
- A developer wishing to create alerts in a declarative manner.

## How does it work?

1. You write SQL to define an alert, for example: `SELECT temp FROM metrics WHERE temp > 30`.
2. You specify how often the SQL should run using CRON notation, such as: `*/5 * * * *`.
3. You define channels and messages that should be sent (Email or Slack).
4. The SQL query runs every time you specify in CRON:
   1. If the SQL query returns any rows, the messages are sent.
   2. If the SQL query does not return rows, the messages are not sent.

## Limits

- Emitbase is still in **beta**. We do not recommend using it for critical production systems.
- Emitbase currently work only with [Po",Core System,"['Provides a foundation for building applications with Emitbase', 'Enables developers to create and manage Emitbase instances', 'Offers essential functionalities for integrating Emitbase into projects']","{""Category"": ""Core System"", ""Problems"": [""Provides a foundation for building applications with Emitbase"", ""Enables developers to create and manage Emitbase instances"", ""Offers essential functionalities for integrating Emitbase into projects""]}"

MIX is a hypothetical computer described by Donald Knuth for
instructive use in The Art of Computer Programming. MIXpy
(pronounced mix-pea) provides a emulator for MIX, as well as an
assembler for the MIX Assembly Language (MIXAL). MIXpy is written
in Python 3, and is available through PyPI as ""mixpy"".

## MIX Emulator
MIXpy realizes the MIX architecture as a collection of Python
objects.

## MIXAL Assembler
MIXAL (""Mix Assembly Language"") is a symbolic language designed
to make ""MIX programs considerably easier to read and to write,
and to save the programmer from worrying about tedious clerical
details that often lead to unnecessary errors"". MIXpy provides a
MIXAL assembler, also exposed as a Python object, to facilitate
the generation of MIX machine code, including the boot and
loading sequences a MIX computer requires to initialize and run a
program.

# Valibot

Hello, I am Valibot and I would like to help you validate data easily using a schema. No matter if it is incoming data on a server, a form or even configuration files. I have no dependencies and can run in any JavaScript environment.

> I highly recommend you read the [announcement post](https://www.builder.io/blog/introducing-valibot), and if you are a nerd like me, the [bachelor's thesis](https://valibot.dev/thesis.pdf) I am based on.

## Highlights

- Fully type safe with static type inference
- Small bundle size starting at less than 300 bytes
- Validate everything from strings to complex objects
- Open source and fully tested with 100 % coverage
- Many transformation and validation helpers included
- Well structured source code without dependencies
- Minimal, readable and well thought out API

## Example

First you create a schema. A schema can be compared to a type definition in TypeScript. The big difference is that TypeScript types are ""not executed"" and are more or less a DX feature.

**openv0** is a generative UI component framework

It allows you to AI generate and iterate on UI components, with live preview.

- **openv0** makes use of open source component libraries and icons to build a library of assets for the generative pipeline.
- **openv0** is highly modular, and structured for elaborate generative processes
- Component generation is a multipass pipeline - where every pass is a fully independent plugin

zippy,Detect AI-generated text [relatively] quickly via compression ratios,https://github.com/thinkst/zippy,2023-06-09T09:44:42Z,2023-10-29T10:45:55Z,Python,123,3,"# ZipPy: Fast method to classify text as AI or human-generated

This is a research repo for fast AI detection using compression.
While there are a number of existing LLM detection systems, they all use a large model trained on either an LLM or
its training data to calculate the probability of each word given the preceeding, then calculating a score where
the more high-probability tokens are more likely to be AI-originated. Techniques and tools in this repo are looking for
faster approximation to be embeddable and more scalable.

## Compression-based detector (`zippy.py` and `nlzmadetect`)

ZipPy uses either the LZMA or zlib compression ratios as a way to indirectly measure the perplexity of a text.
Compression ratios have been used in the past to [detect anomalies in network data](http://owncloud.unsri.ac.id/journal/security/ontheuse_compression_Network_anomaly_detec.pdf)
for intrusion detection, so if perplexity is roughly a measure of anomalous tokens, it may be possible to use compression to detect low-perplexity text.
LZMA and zlib creates a dictionary of seen tokens, and then uses though in place of fut",Data Analysis,"{'Problem 1': 'Detecting AI-generated text', 'Problem 2': 'Analyzing compression ratios', 'Problem 3': 'Quickly identifying suspicious text'}","{""Category"": ""Data Analysis"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Detecting AI-generated text"", ""Problem 2"": ""Analyzing compression ratios"", ""Problem 3"": ""Quickly identifying suspicious text""}}"

Easily integrate Large Language Models into your Python code. Simply use the `@prompt` decorator to create functions that return structured output from the LLM. Mix LLM queries and function calling with regular Python code to create complex logic.

`magentic` is

- **Compact:** Query LLMs without duplicating boilerplate code.
- **Atomic:** Prompts are functions that can be individually tested and reasoned about.
- **Transparent:** Create ""chains"" using regular Python code. Define all of your own prompts.
- **Compatible:** Use `@prompt` functions as normal functions, including with decorators like `@lru_cache`.
- **Type Annotated:** Works with linters and IDEs.

Continue reading for sample usage, or go straight to the [examples directory](examples/).

## Installation

```sh
pip install magentic
```

or using poetry

```sh
poetry add magentic
```

Configure your OpenAI API key by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or using `openai.api_key = ""sk-...""`. See the [OpenAI Python library documentation](https://github.com/openai/openai-python#usage) for more information.

_KitForStartups_ is a starter kit for building and shipping fast, secure, and scalable full stack SaaS applications with SvelteKit and TypeScript.

The starter is built and maintained by [Okupter](https://www.okupter.com).

If you already found yourself in a situation where you were:

- Trying to set up various authentication systems (email/password, social logins, OAuth, etc.)
- Scratching your head over how to structure your app
- Spending too much time setting up payments for your SvelteKit app either with Stripe or Lemon Squeezy
- Fighting against your email provider for sending emails from your app, and testing them reliably on your local machine
- Doing all the above again and again for every new project

Then _KitForStartups_ is for you 🎉!

## Documentation

The documentation for _KitForStartups_ is available at [https://docs.kitforstartups.com](https://docs.kitforstartups.com).

## Community

There's a `#kitforstartups` channel on Okupter Discord where you can ask questions and share your experience with the starter.

Gitness is an open source development platform packed with the power of code hosting and automated continuous integration pipelines.

## Running Gitness locally
> The latest publicly released docker image can be found on [harness/gitness](https://hub.docker.com/r/harness/gitness).

To install Gitness yourself, simply run the command below. Once the container is up, you can visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v /tmp/gitness:/data \
  --name gitness \
  --restart always \

## 🌟 Introduction

For a long time, humanity has pursued artificial intelligence (AI) equivalent to or surpassing human level, with AI agents considered as a promising vehicle of this pursuit. AI agents are artificial entities that sense their environment, make decisions, and take actions. 

Due to the versatile and remarkable capabilities they demonstrate, large language models (LLMs) are regarded as potential sparks for Artificial Gen",Research,"['Gathering comprehensive list of papers on large language model based agents', 'Providing a survey on the rise and potential of large language model based agents', 'Creating a resource for researchers to explore literature on language model based agents']","{""Category"": ""Research"", ""Problems"": [""Gathering comprehensive list of papers on large language model based agents"", ""Providing a survey on the rise and potential of large language model based agents"", ""Creating a resource for researchers to explore literature on language model based agents""]}"

</div>

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g whiz_cli
```

Now, you will need to set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment. You can do this by adding the following to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. On windows, you can set this in the environment variables.

If you want to use a different model than `gpt-3.5-turbo`, then set `WHIZ_LLM_MODEL` to the model name. You can find a list of models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models). As an example, you can set `WHIZ_LLM_MODEL=gpt-4` to use the `gpt-4` model.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
```

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# wz <request>
wz curl google and store response in google.html
wz open google.com in chrome
wz list recent github branches sorted by activity
```

# Superflows

Superflows makes it easy to add an AI assistant to a software product. This lets users ask questions in natural language and the assistant makes calls to the software's API to answer them.

E.g. a CRM user could ask simply:
> What's the status of the B Corp deal?

RestGPT,An LLM-based autonomous agent controlling real-world applications via RESTful APIs,https://github.com/Yifan-Song793/RestGPT,2023-08-26T09:46:40Z,2023-10-29T15:46:41Z,Python,925,40,"# RestGPT

This is the code for the paper [RestGPT: Connecting Large Language Models with Real-World RESTful APIs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06624).

This work aims to construct a **large language model based autonomous agent, RestGPT, to control real-world applications**, such as movie database and music player. To achieve this, we connect LLMs with **RESTful APIs** and tackle the practical challenges of planning, API calling, and response parsing. To fully evaluate the performance of RestGPT, we propose **RestBench**, a high-quality benchmark which consists of two real-world scenarios and human-annotated instructions with gold solution paths.

## What's New

* **[Next]** The demo is under-construction.
* **[2023/8/29]** Code for RestGPT is released.

tddGPT is an autonomous coding agent that builds applications in ReactJS, Flask, Express, and more, all while adhering to the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. It operates entirely without human intervention. Beginning with a project plan, tddGPT translates requirements into tests, develops code based on those tests, and debugs until all tests pass. Currently, it can build simple CRUD apps. The TDD framework keeps the agent focused and goal-oriented.

The core architecture is elegantly simple, utilizing just three tools: CLI, ReadFile, and WriteFile. It has been adpated from Langchain's AutoGPT example. Most enhancements were performed by GPT-4 itself over the course of a month-long chat interaction.

This repository is a fork of the `facebookresearch/llama-recipes`, adapted to fine-tune a Llama-2 7b chat model to replicate your personal WhatsApp texting style. By simply inputting your WhatsApp conversations, you can train the LLM to respond just like you do! Llama-2 7B chat is finetuned using parameter efficient finetuning (QLoRA) and int4 quantization on a single GPU (P100 with 16GB gpu memory).

## My Results

1. **Quick Learning**: The fine-tuned Llama-2 model picked up on my texting nuances rapidly.
   - The average words generated in the finetuned Llama-2 is *300%* more than vanilla Llama-2. I usually type longer replies, so this checks out
   - The model accurately replicated common phrases I say and my emoji usage
  
2. **Turing Test with Friends**: As an experiment, I asked my friends to ask me 3 questions on WhatsApp, and responded with 2 candidate responses (one from me and one from the LLM). My friends then had to guess which candidate response was mine and which one was Llama's.

The result?

> A tool for running large language models on-premises using non-public
> data

**[OnPrem.LLM](https://github.com/amaiya/onprem)** is a simple Python
package that makes it easier to run large language models (LLMs) on your
own machines using non-public data (possibly behind corporate
firewalls). Inspired largely by the
[privateGPT](https://github.com/imartinez/privateGPT) GitHub repo,
**OnPrem.LLM** is intended to help integrate local LLMs into practical
applications.

The full documentation is [here](https://amaiya.github.io/onprem/).

A Google Colab demo of installing and using **OnPrem.LLM** is
[here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LVeacsQ9dmE1BVzwR3eTLukpeRIMmUqi?usp=sharing).

## Install

Once you have [installed
PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [installed
llama-cpp-python](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/llamacpp#installation),
you can install **OnPrem.LLM** with:

``` sh
pip install onprem
```

below](https://ama",Machine Learning,"['Privately run large language models on-premises.', 'Process non-public data with large language models.', 'Ensure data security while utilizing large language models on-premises.']","{""Category"": ""Machine Learning"", ""Problems"": [""Privately run large language models on-premises."", ""Process non-public data with large language models."", ""Ensure data security while utilizing large language models on-premises.""]}"

Paperify transforms any document, web page, or ebook into a research paper.

The text of the generated paper is the same as the text of the original
document, but figures and equations from real papers are interspersed
throughout. 

A paper title and abstract are added (optionally generated by ChatGPT, if you
provide an API key), and the entire paper is compiled with the IEEE $\LaTeX$
template for added realism.

Deploy your apps on Kubernetes easily.

## What is Cuber?

Cuber is an automation tool (written in Ruby) that can package and deploy your apps (written in any language and framework) on Kubernetes.

Unlike other tools that add more options and more complexity to Kubernetes, Cuber is made to simplify and reduce the complexity, thus making the deployment process more standardized and reliable.

You just need to create a `Cuberfile`, with ~10 lines of code, and then type `cuber deploy` to package and deploy your app on any Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes is up to 80% cheaper compared to PaaS like Heroku and you can choose between different cloud providers (no lock-in).
It is also reliable and it can scale applications of any size.
The only downside is that it's complex and requires many steps and configurations, even if most applications share the same needs...

## Overview

CodeRabbit `ai-pr-reviewer` is an AI-based code reviewer and summarizer for
GitHub pull requests using OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` models. It is
designed to be used as a GitHub Action and can be configured to run on every
pull request and review comments

## Reviewer Features:

- **PR Summarization**: It generates a summary and release notes of the changes
  in the pull request.
- **Line-by-line code change suggestions**: Reviews the changes line by line and
  provides code change suggestions.
- **Continuous, incremental reviews**: Reviews are performed on each commit
  within a pull request, rather than a one-time review on the entire pull

datalens,An experiment to automate job search with LLMs,https://github.com/AdrianKrebs/datalens,2023-08-01T13:24:44Z,2023-10-26T20:21:21Z,JavaScript,80,3,"# Datalens: Automate Job Search with AI

## Overview

This is a personal experiment that uses LLMs to rank unstructured job data based on user-defined criteria. 
Traditional job search platforms rely on rigid filtering systems, but many users lack such concrete criteria.
Datalens lets you define your preferences in a more natural way and then rates each job postings based on the relevance.

Some criteria might be more important than others, so ""must criteria"" are weighted twice as much as normal ones.

![Datalens Preview](https://github.com/AdrianKrebs/datalens/blob/master/client/public/preview.png)

Claude-2 example result:
```
 Here are the scores for the provided job posting:
 
{
  ""location"": 1.0,
  ""technology_stack"": 0.8,
  ""industry"": 0.0,
  ""salary"": 0.0 
}

Explanation:
- Location is a perfect match (1.0) as the role is in San Francisco which meets the ""on-site in San Francisco or remote in the US"" criteria.
- Technology stack is a partial match (0.8) as Python, React, and Kubernetes are listed which meet some but not all of the specified technologies. 
- Industry is no match (0.0) as the company is",Job Search Automation,"{'Problem 1': 'Time-consuming manual job search process', 'Problem 2': 'Difficulty in finding relevant job listings', 'Problem 3': 'Lack of personalized job recommendations'}","{""Category"": ""Job Search Automation"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Time-consuming manual job search process"", ""Problem 2"": ""Difficulty in finding relevant job listings"", ""Problem 3"": ""Lack of personalized job recommendations""}}"

 ## Guidance for Azure service teams
Azure service teams should use companion documents, [Azure REST API Guidelines](./azure/Guidelines.md) and [Considerations for Service Design](./azure/ConsiderationsForServiceDesign.md), when building or modifying their services. These documents provide a refined set of guidance targeted specifically for Azure services. For more information please refer to the [README](./azure/README.md) in the Azure folder. 
 
## Guidance for Microsoft Graph service teams
 Microsoft Graph service teams should reference the companion document, [Graph REST API Guidelines](./graph/GuidelinesGraph.md) when building or modifying their services.

In the process of building many of Microsoft's highest scale services, the Microsoft Graph team found the Microsoft API guidelines tremendously useful as a baseline. However, there are several areas where we need to provide more clarity on how developers should describe their APIs. The companion document, [Graph REST API Guidelines](./graph/GuidelinesGraph.md) is a set of amendments and clarifications for Microsoft Graph that a",API Development,"{'Problem 1': 'Ensuring consistent design and implementation of REST APIs', 'Problem 2': 'Improving API discoverability and usability', 'Problem 3': 'Enhancing API security and authentication'}","{""Category"": ""API Development"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Ensuring consistent design and implementation of REST APIs"", ""Problem 2"": ""Improving API discoverability and usability"", ""Problem 3"": ""Enhancing API security and authentication""}}"

Superglue is a lineage-tracking tool to help visualize
the propagation of data through complex pipelines.

![Superglue demo](.github/assets/SuperglueDemo.gif)

## Quick Start

Dependencies:

* JDK 8
* Docker

The first-time setup takes about five minutes.

![Superglue setup](.github/assets/SuperglueSetup.gif)

> **Note**: The gifs show superglue being hosted at `http://localhost:3000`,
> but that has since changed. Be sure to use `http://localhost:8080` instead!

Detailed instructions below!

### Launch the development environment with Docker

We've included a docker configuration to set up all of the services that
superglue needs to run. To launch the development image, run

```
docker-compose -f deployments/development/docker-compose.yml up
```

This launches

* A MySQL database on port `3314`
* The superglue frontend at `http://localhost:8080`

Example
-------

You might write some code like this:

```python
def main(path: str):

    for fn in filenames:
        #<<size = size of fn in bytes>>

        print(fn, size)

#<<use argparse and call main>>

A repository for fast feedforward (FFF) networks.
Fast feedforward layers can be used in place of vanilla feedforward and mixture-of-expert layers, offering inference time that grows only logarithmically in the training width of the layer.

More information can be found in the paper ""Fast Feedforward Networks"" ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14711)).

## Quickstart
1. Install the package.
```
pip install fastfeedforward
```

2. Import the `FFF` layer implementation.
```
from fastfeedforward import FFF
```

3. Use `FFF` in place of feedforward or mixture-of-experts layers, e.g. instead of
```
my_ff = torch.nn.Sequential(
    torch.nn.Linear(input_width, hidden_width, bias=True),
    torch.nn.ReLU(),
    torch.nn.Dropout(p=dropout),
    torch.nn.Linear(hidden_width, output_width, bias=True)
)
```
use
```
depth = ... # your choice of the FFF depth
leaf_width = math.ceil(hidden_width / 2**depth)
region_leak # your choice of the region leak probability (0 - 0.5) to encourage generalisation in very deep FFFs

Each directory corresponds to one effect we tested, and its subdirectories are the raw data of the experiments done on this effect.
In addition, every directory contains ""results.xlsx"", which is an excel file with the data of all the experiments. However, this excel doesn't contain all the information about the experiments, but only what was relevant for the statistical tests.
For experiments with some filtering before the analysis of the results [see paper] additional file, ""filtered.xlsx"", is included.
Each directory also constains ""script.py"", a python script used to analyzed the statistical significance of the results, using ANOVA for the distance effect and T-Test for the rest of the experiments.

GPU architectures are critical to machine learning, and seem to be
becoming even more important every day. However, you can be an expert
in machine learning without ever touching GPU code. It is hard to gain
intuition working through abstractions. 

This notebook is an attempt to teach beginner GPU programming in a
completely interactive fashion. Instead of providing text with
concepts, it throws you right into coding and building GPU
kernels. The exercises use NUMBA which directly maps Python
code to CUDA kernels. It looks like Python but is basically
identical to writing low-level CUDA code. 
In a few hours, I think you can go from basics to
understanding the real algorithms that power 99% of deep learning
today. If you do want to read the manual, it is here:

[NUMBA CUDA Guide](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cuda/index.html)

I recommend doing these in Colab, as it is easy to get started.  Be

Python in Excel is a new feature that allows you to natively combine Python and Excel analytics within the same workbook. With Python in Excel, you can type Python code directly into a cell, the Python calculations run in the Microsoft Cloud, and your results are returned to the worksheet, including plots and visualizations.

![image](https://github.com/microsoft/python-in-excel/assets/3476087/24dce9a3-a220-4c18-b5e1-f9fd4223b1f6)


Python in Excel leverages Anaconda Distribution for Python running in Azure, which includes the most popular Python libraries (e.g. pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.), and is securely built, tested, and supported by Anaconda. Python code used by Excel runs on the Microsoft Cloud with enterprise-level security as a compliant Microsoft 365 connected experience. The Python code runs in its own hypervisor isolated container using Azure Container Instances and secure, source-built packages from Anaconda through a secure software supply chain.

## Get Started with Python in Excel

### GPT Pilot helps developers build apps 20x faster

You specify what kind of app you want to build. Then, GPT Pilot asks clarifying questions, creates the product and technical requirements, sets up the environment, and **starts coding the app step by step, like in real life, while you oversee the development process**. It asks you to review each task it finishes or to help when it gets stuck. This way, GPT Pilot acts as a coder while you are a lead dev who reviews code and helps when needed.

This is the official implementation of [Graph of Thoughts: Solving Elaborate Problems with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09687.pdf).  
This framework gives you the ability to solve complex problems by modeling them as a Graph of Operations (GoO), which is automatically executed with a Large Language Model (LLM) as the engine.  
This framework is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to not only solve problems using the new GoT approach, but also to implement GoOs resembling previous approaches like CoT or ToT.

## Setup Guide

In order to use this framework, you need to have a working installation of Python 3.8 or newer.

### Installing GoT

Before running either of the following two installation methods, make sure to activate your Python environment (if any) beforehand.  
If you are a user and you just want to use `graph_of_thoughts`, you can install it directly from PyPI:
```bash
pip install graph_of_thoughts
```

Code Llama is a family of large language models for code based on [Llama 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama) providing state-of-the-art performance among open models, infilling capabilities, support for large input contexts, and zero-shot instruction following ability for programming tasks. We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama was developed by fine-tuning Llama 2 using a higher sampling of code. As with Llama 2, we applied considerable safety mitigations to the fine-tuned versions of the model. For detailed information on model training, architecture and parameters, evaluations, responsible AI and safety refer to  our [research paper](https://ai.meta.com/r",Machine Learning,"['Conducting inference with CodeLlama models', 'Generating predictions using CodeLlama models', 'Applying CodeLlama models to new data']","{""Category"": ""Machine Learning"", ""Problems"": [""Conducting inference with CodeLlama models"", ""Generating predictions using CodeLlama models"", ""Applying CodeLlama models to new data""]}"

This repository contains the ARC task data, as well as a browser-based interface for humans to try their hand at solving the tasks manually.

*""ARC can be seen as a general artificial intelligence benchmark, as a program synthesis benchmark, or as a psychometric intelligence test. It is targeted at both humans and artificially intelligent systems that aim at emulating a human-like form of general fluid intelligence.""*

A complete description of the dataset, its goals, and its underlying logic, can be found in: [On the Measure of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547).

As a reminder, a test-taker is said to solve a task when, upon seeing the task for the first time, they are able to produce the correct output grid for *all* test inputs in the task (this includes picking the dimensions of the output grid). For each test input, the test-taker is allowed 3 trials (this holds for all test-takers, either humans or AI).

speed being one of them.

jump through placeholders and add text while the snippet inserts text in other

updated to call the base class constructor. When I add arguments to the
constructor, they automatically get assigned to instance variables. I then

""one backup is saf, two are safe, three are safer""

> Current saf version is 0.16, saf requires Python 3.10 or newer

**saf** is a simple, reliable, rsync-based, battle tested, well rounded backup system, written in Python.

It uses rsync to incrementally back up your data to a different directory, hard disk or remote server via SSH. All operations are incremental, atomic and optionally possible to resume.

**saf** is using very limited set of commands in the background, so it plays well with storage shells with limited set of commands, like Hetzner Storage Box.

Main backup code is used in production for many years and has proved its reliability, while recent **saf** updates only improve user facing commands. No guarantees but should be safe to use.

`./setup.sh`

to install all dependencies and set the `KTKB_PATH` env variable.

```bash
./ktkb use to-do
./ktkb init # assuming the board did not exist before
./ktkb add 'Walk the dog'
./ktkb add 'Feed the cat'
./ktkb list # see all tasks
./ktkb init -n done
./ktkb mv 0 --from 'to-do' --to done # Mark a task as done
```

You can also add `./ktkb` to `bin` directory so it can be run from anywhere:
`cp ./ktkb /usr/local/bin/`

## How to Use 🚀

🌱 Create a new board:

`python -m kantankanban init -n $BOARD_NAME`

🔎 See all available boards:

`python -m kantankanban list -n boards`

📓 List all cards in a board:

`python -m kantankanban list -n $BOARD_NAME` (Yes, the board list is just another meta-board!)

This command will result in something like this:

**🚧 Work in progress! 🚧** Despite major version 1 because of <https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1507>. Trying to not make breaking changes, but devil is in the details.

![logo](resources/images/logo.png)

This library is strongly influenced by the awesome [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts).

## Getting started

```bash
go get github.com/IBM/fp-go
```

Refer to the [samples](./samples/).

Find API documentation [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go)

## Design Goal

This library aims to provide a set of data types and functions that make it easy and fun to write maintainable and testable code in golang. It encourages the following patterns:

- write many small, testable and pure functions, i.e. functions that produce output only depending on their input and that do not execute side effects
- offer helpers to isolate side effects into lazily executed functions (IO)
- expose a consistent set of composition to create new functions from existing ones
  - for each data type there exists a small set of composition functions",Software Development,"['Implementing functional programming paradigms in Golang', 'Managing complex data transformations in Golang', 'Building more modular and maintainable code in Golang']","{""Category"": ""Software Development"", ""Problems"": [""Implementing functional programming paradigms in Golang"", ""Managing complex data transformations in Golang"", ""Building more modular and maintainable code in Golang""]}"

https://github.com/vanna-ai/vanna/assets/7146154/1901f47a-515d-4982-af50-f12761a3b2ce

## How Vanna works
Vanna works in two easy steps - train a model on your data, and then ask questions.

1. **Train a model on your data**.
2. **Ask questions**.

When you ask a question, we utilize a custom model for your dataset to generate SQL, as seen below. Your model performance and accuracy depends on the quality and quantity of training data you use to train your model.

Ubicloud is an open, free, and portable cloud. Think of it as an open alternative to
cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems.

Ubicloud provides IaaS cloud features on bare metal providers, such as Hetzner, OVH, 
and AWS Bare Metal. You can set it up yourself on these providers or you can use our 
managed service. We're currently in public alpha.

## Quick start

### Managed platform

You can use Ubicloud without installing anything. When you do this, we pass along the 
underlying provider's benefits to you, such as price or location.

Serverless, lightweight, and fast vector store on top of DynamoDB

## Description

Whiplash is a lightweight vector store built on top of [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). It uses a variant of [locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) to index vectors in a DynamoDB table. This is intended to be a mimimalist, scalable, and fast vector store and is intended to be extremely easy to use, maintain, and self-host.

There are several main components to Whiplash:

- **Whiplash Serverless API** - A fully functional API that can be deployed to AWS with a few commands.
- **Whiplash Client / SDK** - A Python library that can be used to interact directly with Whiplash internals (talks directly to DynamoDB) or via the API.
- **Whiplash CLI** - A CLI that can be used to interact with the Whiplash Serverless API. (TODO)

## Introduction

The Swiss Army Llama is designed to facilitate and optimize the process of working with local LLMs by using FastAPI to expose convenient REST endpoints for various tasks, including obtaining text embeddings and completions using different LLMs via llama_cpp, as well as automating the process of obtaining all the embeddings for most common document types, including PDFs (even ones that require OCR), Word file, etc; it even allows you to submit an audio file and automatically transcribes it with the Whisper model, cleans up the resulting text, and then computes the embeddings for it. To avoid wasting computation, these embeddings are cached in SQlite and retrieved if they have already been computed before. To speed up the process of loading multiple LLMs, optional RAM Disks can be used, and the process for creating and managing them is handled automatically for you.

# What is Serra?
Serra provides a library of readers, transformers and writers to simplify the process of writing data pipelines.

For example, you can specify that you want to read a CSV file from an S3 bucket, apply a transformation to the data, then write the data to a Snowflake table with the following config:

```yaml
step_read:
  S3Reader:
    bucket_name: serrademo
    file_path: sales.csv
    file_type: csv

step_map:
  MapTransformer:
    input_block: step_read
    name: 'state_abbreviation'
    map_dict_path: 'examples/states_to_abbreviation.json'
    col_key: 'region'

step_write:
  SnowflakeWriter:
   input_block: step_map
   warehouse: compute_wh
   database: serra
   schema: demo
   table: sales_mapped
   type: create
```

# How does it work?
Every step of the data pipeline corresponds to a specific class in the Serra framework. Above there are three classes that are used.

These are defined in the folders readers, writers, and transformers. If you decide you want to support a new type of step, you simply write corresponding PySpark code in a new file in thes",Data Engineering,"['Efficiently process and transform large volumes of data using Spark', 'Create scalable and reliable data pipelines', 'Automate data ingestion and integration processes']","{

*yet another redundant workflow engine*

**redun** aims to be a more expressive and efficient workflow framework, built on top of the popular Python programming language. It takes the somewhat contrarian view that writing dataflows directly is unnecessarily restrictive, and by doing so we lose abstractions we have come to rely on in most modern high-level languages (control flow, composability, recursion, high order functions, etc). redun's key insight is that workflows can be expressed as [lazy expressions](#whats-the-trick), which are then evaluated by a scheduler that performs automatic parallelization, caching, and data provenance logging.

redun's key features are:

- Workflows are defined by lazy expressions that when evaluated emit dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), enabling complex data flows.
- Incremental computation that is reactive to both data changes as well as code changes.
- Workflow tasks can be executed on a variety of compute backend (threads, processes, AWS batch jobs, Spark jobs, etc). 
- Data changes are detected for in-memory",Workflow Engine,"['Automating and orchestrating complex workflows', 'Eliminating manual and error-prone processes', 'Streamlining business processes']","{""Category"": ""Workflow Engine"", ""Problems"": [""Automating and orchestrating complex workflows"", ""Eliminating manual and error-prone processes"", ""Streamlining business processes""]}"

# node-calls-python - call Python from Node.js directly in-process without spawning processes

## Suitable for running your ML or deep learning models from Node directly

[![Donate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-green.svg)](https://www.paypal.me/hmenyus)

## Motivation
Current solutions spawn a new process whenever you want to run Python code in Node.js and communicate via IPC using sockets, stdin/stdout, etc.
But creating new processes every time you want to run Python code could be a major overhead and can lead to significant performance penalties.
If the execution time of your Python code is less than creating a new process, you will see significant performance problems because your Node.js code will keep creating new processes instead of executing your Python code.
Suppose you have a few NumPy calls in Python: do you want to create a new process for that? I guess your answer is no. 
In this case, running the Python code in-process is a much better solution because using the embedded Python interpreter i",Interoperability,"{'Problem 1': 'Simplify communication between NodeJS and Python', 'Problem 2': 'Eliminate overhead of spawning separate Python processes', 'Problem 3': 'Improve performance by enabling direct in-process communication'}","{""Category"": ""Interoperability"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Simplify communication between NodeJS and Python"", ""Problem 2"": ""Eliminate overhead of spawning separate Python processes"", ""Problem 3"": ""Improve performance by enabling direct in-process communication""}}"

Dragonfly is an open source python library for scalable Bayesian optimisation.

Bayesian optimisation is used for optimising black-box functions whose evaluations are
usually expensive. Beyond vanilla optimisation techniques, Dragonfly provides an array of tools to
scale up Bayesian optimisation to expensive large scale problems.
These include features/functionality that are especially suited for
high dimensional optimisation (optimising for a large number of variables),
parallel evaluations in synchronous or asynchronous settings (conducting multiple
evaluations in parallel), multi-fidelity optimisation (using cheap approximations
to speed up the optimisation process), and multi-objective optimisation (optimising
multiple functions simultaneously).

Dragonfly is compatible with Python2 (>= 2.7) and Python3 (>= 3.5) and has been tested
on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms.
For documentation, installation, and a getting started guide, see our
[readthedocs page](https://dragonfly-opt.readthedocs.io). For more details, see

[![CI](https://github.com/fmeringdal/covert/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/fmeringdal/covert/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Covert is a secrets management solution written in Rust that leverages [SQLCipher](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher) for encrypted storage and [Litestream](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream) for replication. Covert has a very similar API to [HashiCorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault) and takes a lot of inspiration from it, but aims to be a simpler and more affordable option. Some of the features included are:

- Versioned Key-Value secrets
- Dynamic secrets (only PostgreSQL currently)
- Namespaces
- Streaming replication
- Type safe and flexible framework for writing new secrets engines and authentication methods

**NOTE**: This is a experimental software which is not yet suitable for production use-cases.

## Getting started

Install Covert with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/index.html)
```sh
cargo install covert
```

Start the Covert server

Eigensheep gives your Lambda code full access both to packages from PyPi, and to layers from [Lambda Layers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-layers.html), including typically tricky-to-install things like `Z3`, `ffmpeg`, and `puppeteer`.

## Features

- Just prefix a cell with `%%eigensheep` to run it on AWS Lambda
- Automatically generates Lambda deployment packages with pre-installed dependencies via `pip`. 
- Supports Lambda Layers for easily including external libraries like Z3, FFm",Data Science,"{'Problem 1': 'Performing massively parallel experimentation on Jupyter and AWS Lambda', 'Problem 2': 'Managing and analyzing large datasets in a distributed manner', 'Problem 3': 'Optimizing computational resources for data science experiments'}","{""Category"": ""Data Science"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Performing massively parallel experimentation on Jupyter and AWS Lambda"", ""Problem 2"": ""Managing and analyzing large datasets in a distributed manner"", ""Problem 3"": ""Optimizing computational resources for data science experiments""}}"

agentflow,Complex LLM Workflows from Simple JSON.,https://github.com/simonmesmith/agentflow,2023-08-02T20:57:16Z,2023-10-26T17:43:03Z,Python,233,16,"# Agentflow: Complex LLM Workflows from Simple JSON

![Python lint and test](https://github.com/simonmesmith/agentflow/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Agentflow is a powerful yet user-friendly tool to run workflows powered by LLMs. You can:

* **Write workflows in plain English** in human-readable JSON files.
* **Use variables for dynamic outputs** that change based on user input.
* **Build and execute custom functions** to go beyond text generation.

## Why Agentflow?

Agentflow fills the gap between chat and autonomous interfaces:

* **Chat (e.g. ChatGPT) can't run workflows** because they're conversational.
* **Autonomous (e.g. Auto-GPT) run them unreliably** because they have too much freedom.

Agentflow offers a balanced solution: Workflows that LLMs follow step-by-step.

## Install and Use

Agentflow is currently in development. To try it:

1. Sign up for the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/overview) and get an [API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key)

## ⚙️ How it works

This project extends [smol developer](https://github.com/smol-ai/developer) by giving it access to a [sandbox](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox) to run tests in. The agent iterates until all tests pass, by updating the code and fixing the environment (installing packages).

### 📦 Environment templates

The project uses environment ""templates"" to define the basic setup and test harness for a given language/framework. For now, three templates are provided:

- React + Jest
- Python
- Rust

However, any language/framework should work, as long as it can be installed within a container.

This is a Rust implementation of Llama2 inference on CPU

The goal is to be as fast as possible. 

It has the following features:

* Support for 4-bit GPT-Q Quantization 
* Batched prefill of prompt tokens
* SIMD support for fast CPU inference
* Memory mapping, loads 70B instantly.
* Static size checks for safety
* Support for Grouped Query Attention (needed for big Llamas)
* Python calling API 

Can run up on *1 tok/s* 70B Llama2 and *9 tok/s* 7B Llama2. (on my intel i9 desktop)

## Web API

It uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to provide payments infrastructure, so users can buy `bibs` - the API tokens. [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) is used to provide authentication and authorization. You can use them for free - Auth0 has a free tier up to 7000 users per month. Stripe only charges fees from purchases, so you have no ongoing costs from any of them.

If you want to use these services, you have to set up your Stripe and Auth0 accounts and put API keys into `.env` in `web-api/` directory.

Node.js, TypeScript and Express are used here

### .env

`.env_example` shows which values you have to set

```
CHATBOT_API_KEY={whatever you decide; this value is reused among ai-api, web-api and web in this project}
OPEN_AI_API_KEY={go to platform.openai.com, generate and copy-paste api key here}

Once you learn how to hold a card while making your hand look empty, you only need practice before you, too, can “do magic.” – Jeffrey Friedl in the book Mastering Regular Expressions

This general CLI for LLM chats is designed to support as many AI interfaces as possible. It supports simple chat modes as well as a shell modes. This shell takes your commands and does what you ask via translating them to intermediate scripting languages and running them. Beware the risk of AI running or deleting something you didn't expect. Use at your own risk. Whatever mode you use you may choose to override the AI temperature via the environment variable: 
`AISH_TEMP` defaults to 0.2. Sessions are not currently persisted to disk and each run is a new thread.

# About

Fusio is an open source API management platform which helps to create innovative API solutions. We know that building a
complete API product is no easy task, because of this we have created Fusio which supports you in every aspect of the
API life cycle:  

* __Building__  
  Fusio provides many ways to build new API endpoints, it can proxy existing APIs, directly work with external databases
  or files and it is also possible to implement custom business logic 
* __Documentation__  
  Fusio contains a schema store which can be used to describe the request and response payloads of each endpoint. Those
  schemas are then used to generate i.e. an OpenAPI specification or also client SDKs.
* __Monetization__  
  Fusio provides a simple way to monetize your existing API by using an payment provider like Stripe.
* __Onboarding__  
  Fusio provides a ready to use developer portal where external developers can register to consume your API.
* __Integration__ ",API Management,"['1. Streamlining and managing APIs effectively', '2. Securing APIs and managing access control', '3.

Lightweight Kubernetes.  Production ready, easy to install, half the memory, all in a binary less than 100 MB.

Great for:

* Edge
* IoT
* CI
* Development
* ARM
* Embedding k8s
* Situations where a PhD in k8s clusterology is infeasible

K3s is a [fully conformant](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance/pulls?q=is%3Apr+k3s) production-ready Kubernetes distribution with the following changes:

1. It is packaged as a single binary.
1. It adds support for sqlite3 as the default storage backend. Etcd3, MySQL, and Postgres are also supported.
1. It wraps Kubernetes and other components in a single, simple launcher.
1. It is secure by default with reasonable defaults for lightweight environments.
1. It has minimal to no OS dependencies (just a sane kernel and cgroup mounts needed).
1. It eliminates the need to expose a port on Kubernetes worker nodes for the kubelet API by exposing this API to the Kubernetes control plane nodes over a websocket tunnel.

K3s bundles the following technologies together into a single coh",Container Orchestration,"{'Problem 1': 'Deploying and managing lightweight Kubernetes clusters', 'Problem 2': 'Running Kubernetes on resource-constrained environments', 'Problem 3': 'Streamlining and simplifying the deployment and management processes of Kubernetes'}","{""Category"": ""Container Orchestration"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Deploying and managing lightweight Kubernetes clusters"", ""Problem 2"": ""Running Kubernetes on resource-constrained environments"", ""Problem 3"": ""Streamlining and simplifying the deployment and management processes of Kubernetes""}}"

A multiplayer gameboy powered by WebRTC and [Nitric](https://nitric.io/).

> The emulator used in this project was not authored by me and is located [here](https://github.com/roblouie/gameboy-emulator). Have made minor tweaks to it for streaming audio.

NOTE: All WebRTC communication is Peer to peer with no relays (TURN servers). If you have any issues connecting to a peer it is likely that a TURN server will be required.

## Game Modes

This game can be hosted in three modes:

### Chaos

A chaos game accepts all player input (as if all players were holding the same gameboy).

### Shuffle

Controls are divided amongst all players on a random basis every 60 seconds.

### Hotseat

Controls are passed between players every 60 seconds.

## Development
### Requirements
  - [Nitric CLI](https://nitric.io/docs/guides/getting-started/installation)
  - Node.js
  - yarn

To run the project locally you can simply run `yarn dev`. If you have any issues raise one against this repo.

**[Diff](DIFF.md):** A `diff` transformation and application for `Dataset`s that computes the differences between
two datasets, i.e. which rows to _add_, _delete_ or _change_ to get from one dataset to the other.

**[SortedGroups](GROUPS.md):** A `groupByKey` transformation that groups rows by a key while providing
a **sorted** iterator for each group. Similar to `Dataset.groupByKey.flatMapGroups`, but with order guarantees
for the iterator.

**[Histogram](HISTOGRAM.md):** A `histogram` transformation that computes the histogram DataFrame for a value column.

**[Global Row Number](ROW_NUMBER.md):** A `withRowNumbers` transformation that provides the global row number w.r.t.
the current order of the Dataset, or any given order. In contrast to the existing SQL function `row_number`, which
requires a window spec, this transformation provides the row number across the entire Dataset without scaling problems.

Marsha is an LLM-based programming language. Describe what you want done with a simple syntax, provide examples of usage, and the Marsha compiler will guide an LLM to produce tested Python software.

## Usage

The Marsha compiler can be used to compile the syntax using a `pip` module via a terminal or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/alantech/marsha
python -m marsha data_mangling.mrsh
```

## Syntax

The Marsha syntax looks a lot like markdown and is a mixture of English and mathematical notation. It has its own file format `.mrsh` that houses function definition(s). The syntax is subject to change as Marsha is currently in an alpha state.

This is an experiment on using AI to generate news articles.

The system collects programming news from multiple sources, selects the relevant
items and summarizes them.

You can add your own sources and adjust the prompts to make it write accordingly
to your own editorial policy and biases.

You need to create a `.env` file with your OpenAI key, in this format

```

```

### How it works:

The system performs the following steps:

1 - Scanner\
Collects top items from the source URLs. Results are stored in a database and
each item is marked as ""pending"".

2 -
[Revalance filter](https://github.com/lfarroco/news-radar/blob/main/src/candidates.ts)\
Picks ""pending"" items and asks the AI to identify what are the most relevant
ones according to the target audience. Items are marked as ""approved"".

3 - Scrapper\
Articles marked as ""approved"" are scraped. The resulting content is stored in
the database.

4 - [Writer](https://github.com/lfarroco/news-radar/blob/main/src/writer.ts)\

A ChatGPT powered React Code Generator

Specify what kind of React component you want to build and directly get the code and a live preview.

With GPT React Designer you can easily get a quick preview of the React code generated by ChatGPT. Engineers can use it to draft up components and then copy it into their main code base. The code generated by GPT React Designer is styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) or plain inline CSS.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to have a playground for frontend developers to quickly generate and try out code snippets. In the current state it only understands TailwindCSS and plain inline CSS but this could easily be extended.

## Example

https://github.com/XD2Sketch/gpt-react-designer/assets/5519740/f42c36ed-62cc-4275-9d19-86b6028961b0

## Roadmap

Things we could add:

- Support for other styling frameworks (ChakraUI, ...)
- Setup entire projects
- Auto-save and deploy projects to Vercel or Netlify
- TypeScript support
- Provide context to an existing project that needs to be extended
- Export React code to Figma

Juno is an AI collaborator for your Jupyter notebooks. Ask `juno` to write full cells of code and answer questions about your data. Juno understands your notebook context, and can even auto-debug your code as you go.

## Getting Started Guide

To use Juno, you need to install the Juno package.
```bash
pip install juno-ai
```

Or you can also install directly from your Jupyter notebook.
```bash
%pip install juno-ai
```

### Load the extension

Load the extension into your current Jupyter notebook. 
```python
%load_ext juno
```

> For those new to Jupyter extensions, note you must load the extension at the top of each notebook.

## Using Juno

You can ask Juno to write code for you by running `%juno` followed by your prompt in a cell.

It can write functions, create plots, or do data analysis in pandas.
It knows about the variables you have defined in your notebook, so you ask it to work with your data without giving additional context.

## Target Audience 

This course is for Python programmers who want to move beyond 
short scripts to writing more sophisticated programs.  Topics
focus on programming techniques that get used in popular libraries and
frameworks. The primary goal is to better understand the Python language
itself so that you can understand other people's code and so that you
can apply your newfound knowledge to your own projects.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown huge success in different text generation tasks and
enable developers to build generative agents based on objectives expressed in natural language.

However, most generative agents require heavy customization for specific purposes, and
supporting different use cases can sometimes be overwhelming using existing tools
and frameworks. As a result, it is still very challenging to build a custom generative agent.

In addition, evaluating such generative agents, which is usually done by manually trying different
scenarios, is a very manual, repetitive, and expensive task.

AutoChain takes inspiration from LangChain and AutoGPT and aims to solve
both problems by providing a lightweight and extensible framework
for developers to build their own agents using LLMs with custom tools and
[automatically evaluating](#workflow-evaluation) different user scenarios with simulated
conversations. Experienced user of LangChain would find AutoChain is easy to navigate since
they share similar but simpler concepts.

## Description

This is a collection of personal blogs from the [Ask HN: Could you share your personal blog here?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36575081) 
thread on Hacker News, prepared as OPML for easy import into your favorite RSS reader.

## Usage

Download [list.opml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs/master/list.opml) and import it into your favorite RSS reader.

There is an alternative list as well, blogs that were added after submission to the HN post - [listx.opml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outcoldman/hackernews-personal-blogs/master/listx.opml).

When building this list, I have ignored any user with less or equal to 1 karma, which means I might have missed some
interesting blogs, but at the same time I wanted to ignore spam or throwaway accounts.

The list is sorted by the user karma on Hacker News, so the first blogs are from users with the highest karma.

You can modify the list in your editor to include only the top 10 or 100 blogs, or to remov",Data Analysis,"{'Problem 1': 'Identifying popular topics among Hacker News users', 'Problem 2': 'Analyzing the writing styles and interests of Hacker News users', 'Problem 3': 'Discovering connections and collaborations between Hacker News users through their blogs'}","{

Multi-hop declarative data pipelines

## What is Hoptimator?

Hoptimator is an SQL-based control plane for complex data pipelines.

Hoptimator turns high-level SQL _subscriptions_ into multi-hop data pipelines. Pipelines may involve an auto-generated Flink job (or similar) and any arbitrary resources required for the job to run. 

## How does it work?

Hoptimator has a pluggable _adapter_ framework, which lets you wire-up arbtitary data sources. Adapters loosely correspond to connectors in the underlying compute engine (e.g. Flink Connectors), but they may include custom control plane logic. For example, an adapter may create a cache or a CDC stream as part of a pipeline. This enables a single pipeline to span multiple ""hops"" across different systems (as opposed to, say, a single Flink job).

Hoptimator's pipelines tend to have the following general shape:

                                    _________
    topic1 ----------------------> |         |
    table2 --> CDC ---> topic2 --> | SQL job | --> topic4
    table3 --> rETL --> topic3 --> |_________|

Yes, you can still use this software. It just won't recieve any updates now.

> The reason behind shutting the project down is that a developer with write access to the code published a [problematic video](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop/commit/cf7ba1caf932e8c9f39d972100f74022e7372c27) to the documentation of the project.

## Description

This repo contains an implementation of the following AutoEncoders:

* [Vanilla AutoEncoders - **AE**](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/): </br>
  The most basic autoencoder structure is one which simply maps input data-points through a __bottleneck layer__ whose dimensionality is smaller than the input.

* [Variational AutoEncoders - **VAE**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908): </br>
  The Variational Autoencoder introduces the constraint
that the latent code `z` is a random variable distributed according to a prior distribution `p(z)`.

* [Adversarially Constrained Autoencoder Interpolations - **ACAI**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07543):</br>
A critic network tries to predict the interpolation coefficient α corresponding to an interpolated datapoint. The autoencoder is
trained to fool the critic into outputting α = 0.</br>

### Abstract

How does language inform our downstream thinking? In particular, how do humans make meaning from language — and how can we leverage a theory of linguistic meaning to build machines that think in more human-like ways?
In this paper, we propose _rational meaning construction_, a computational framework for language-informed thinking that combines neural models of language with probabilistic models for rational inference. We frame linguistic meaning as a context-sensitive mapping from natural language into a _probabilistic language of thought_ (PLoT) — a general-purpose symbolic substrate for probabilistic, generative world modeling. Our architecture integrates two powerful computational tools that have not previously come together: we model thinking with _probabilistic programs_, an expressive representation for flexible commonsense reasoning; and we model meaning construction with _large language models_ (LLMs), which support broad-cove",Machine Learning,"{'Problem 1': 'Modelling complex real-world environments', 'Problem 2': 'Generating synthetic data for training machine learning models', 'Problem 3': 'Simulating and predicting real-world scenarios'}","{

Talk to any GitHub repository and ask questions about the codebase. This app provides an interactive way to explore and understand and modify projects hosted on GitHub.

The app is hosted here: https://talk-to-repo.arjeo.com/. Instructions for hosting it yourself are provided below.

## Features

- Load any GitHub repository
- Input a GitHub API token for private repositories
- When loading the repo, the app checks locally for any secrets in files and discards sensitive files to avoid sending secrets to the AI
- Export the messages you see (currently to a new tab)
- Collect code that is relevant for changes you wish to do
- You can see the prompt used behind the scenes to generate the response
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Basic architecture

The app is a NextJS/Tailwind CSS frontend with a FastAPI backend. The backend uses a Pinecone vector DB on the free tier.

# aider is AI pair programming in your terminal

Aider is a command line tool that lets you pair program with GPT-3.5/GPT-4,
to edit code stored in your local git repository.
You can start a new project or work with an existing repo.
And you can fluidly switch back and forth between the aider chat where you ask
GPT to edit the code and your own editor to make changes yourself.
Aider makes sure edits from you and GPT are
[committed to git](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#how-does-aider-use-git)
with sensible commit messages.
Aider is unique in that it [works well with pre-existing, larger codebases](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html).

It's hard trying to manage a postgresql database by yourself especially when you have little experience with databases. I started by writing simple queries which were required for analytics. But the systems were also facing other issues which pushed me to delve deeper into postgres. The majority of the issues were quite simple and were there due to the lack of a DBA/DBRE. During my journey with postgres, I came across [Accidental DBA](https://github.com/pgexperts/accidentalDBA/). This helped me quite a bit at that time but there were still a few things that I picked up over the years. I wanted to write this document to share what I have learned over the years and make it a little easier for another Accidental DBA to work with postgres. Since I have primarily worked with RDS Postgres (managed postgres service provided by AWS), there might be a few things related to postgres setup missing here.

# Setting up postgres

simpleaichat is a Python package for easily interfacing with chat apps like ChatGPT and GPT-4 with robust features and minimal code complexity. This tool has many features optimized for working with ChatGPT as fast and as cheap as possible, but still much more capable of modern AI tricks than most implementations:

- Create and run chats with only a few lines of code!
- Optimized workflows which minimize the amount of tokens used, reducing costs and latency.
- Run multiple independent chats at once.
- Minimal codebase: no code dives to figure out what's going on under the hood needed!
- Chat streaming responses and the ability to use tools.
- Async support, including for streaming and tools.
- Ability to create more complex yet clear workflows if needed, such as Agents. (Demo soon!)
- Coming soon: more chat model support (PaLM, Claude)!

Here's some fun, hackable examples on how simpleaichat works:

`$ pip install diarycli`

One CLI command to create and organize your diaries in the terminal.

`$ diary` opens a CLI editor to today's diary (path: `$DIARY_DIR/year/month/date.md`)

`$ diary cat` cat the content of today's diary to terminal.

`$ diary 2020-01-01` create a diary entry for 2020/01/01 in the appropriate file path.

Use environment argument `DIARY_DIR` and `DIARY_EDITOR` to configure where the diary are and what editor to use, by default, it use `vim` as editor and `~/diary` as path for diary.

When installing via `pip`, if you see following message:

```
WARNING: The script diary is installed in '/some/path/examples/bin' which is not on PATH
Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location
```

You may want to add this location to `PATH`, to do that, add the following line to your `.rc` file:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/some/path/examples/bin

 - CS 61A concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
 - CS 61B deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.

Stop flushing your performance down the drain.

## Overview

This command line tool uses Linux's `perf_event_open` functionality to compare the performance of multiple commands
with a colorful terminal user interface.

![image](https://github.com/andrewrk/poop/assets/106511/6fc9d22b-f95b-46ce-8dc5-d5cecc77c226)

## Usage

```
Usage: poop [options] <command1> ... <commandN>

Compares the performance of the provided commands.

Options:
 --duration <ms>    (default: 5000) how long to repeatedly sample each command

## Comparison with Hyperfine

Poop (so far) is brand new, whereas
[Hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) is a mature project with more
configuration options and generally more polish.

However, poop does report peak memory usage as well as 5 other hardware
counters, which I personally find useful when doing performance testing. Hey,
maybe it will inspire the Hyperfine maintainers to add the extra data points!

You can check out the canonical deployment of marche at https://www.cest-le-marche.com
Everything on the main branch of this repository is automatically deployed to that URL.

## What makes Marche different?

The primary difference between Marche and other forum softwares is the inclusion of items. 
When a user posts a thread or a reply, there is a random chance that the user will be given 
an item. These items can include cosmetic items such a profile pictures or backgrounds and 
badges that the user can equip. 

The other type of item that can drop are reactions. A user can use a reaction one time 
on any post other then one of their own to show appreciation or the opposite. Reactions add
or subtract experience points from the recipient. 

Experience points grant users special priviliges, the most prominent example as of right now
being the ability to attach photos to posts after a certain level. This change was made in

Epiphany,A note-taking App with a static blog generator focusing on technical writing,https://github.com/shi-yan/Epiphany,2022-11-24T00:03:53Z,2023-09-27T03:16:18Z,JavaScript,64,6,"# Epiphany

Epiphany is an open-source note-taking app that draws inspiration from Notion. I created Epiphany on a whim because I wanted a platform to document my AI learning journey. After researching various options such as Medium, dev.to, and Substack, I found that they were not suitable for technical writing. Additionally, blogging platforms come and go, and I didn't want to risk losing my content due to platform shutdowns or migrations. With Epiphany, I have complete control over my content, and I don't have to worry about losing it. I can easily export my data in an open format (djot [https://djot.net/](https://djot.net/)) and use it in other applications. 

I also considered static site generators, but I found that editing raw markdown files was less than ideal, particularly when it came to previewing math equations. With Epiphany, you have the best of both worlds: a user-friendly interface for organizing and taking notes, the ability to save your data in open formats and publish them as a blog.

Agency is a python library that provides an [Actor
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) framework for creating
agent-integrated systems.

The library provides an easy to use API that enables you to connect agents with
traditional software systems in a flexible and scalable way, allowing you to
develop any architecture you need.

Agency's goal is to enable developers to create custom agent-based applications
by providing a minimal foundation to both experiment and build upon. So if
you're looking to build a custom agent system of your own, Agency might be for
you.

## Features

## Features

1. All the goodness of modern, async FastAPI
2. Seamless Jinja2 templating, just like Flask
3. SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations (PostgreSQL)
4. Flask-Admin plugged right in
5. Pipenv for python dependency management

Explore the [full docs here](./docs/index.md)

## Get Started

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or create your own)
2. `docker-compose up -d` to start the database
3. `pipenv shell`
4. `FASTAPI_STATICDIGEST_RELOAD=1 uvicorn app.main:create_app --port=8080 --reload`

### Configuration

 - Change the database configuration/credentials in `.env` and `docker-compose.yaml`
 - Set `DEBUG_ADMIN=1` to disable the authorization for the admin panel

## Why?

The dependency-injection provided by FastAPI is such a huge improvement over any other python web framework. It's OpenAPI integration is excellent, and it's `asgi`-first, unlike Flask or Django.

But Django is famous for its admin panel, and the ability to rapidly build server side applications. For this, we include Flask-Admin, and centralied Jinja2 templates as a dependency.

- Almost never!
- You irrationally dislike decision trees (e.g., for their stepwise behavior) and feel neural networks (with their smoothness) are much cooler. 🤪
- You want to prove a point about neural networks. 👨‍🏫
- You think that converting the tree to a NN and then fine-tuning it might decrease the value of your loss metric on your test set. 🪄

# YuLan-IR

YuLan-IR is part of YuLan, an open source LLM initiative proposed by Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. 

## Overview

In this repository, we hope to explore the combination between Information Retrieval (IR) and generative language models, including but not limited to: 
- Augmenting generation with information retrieval to alleviate the hallucination of language models.
- Improving information retrieval with language models. For example, using language models to help IR models determine whether a document / passage is useful.
- etc.

A fast and low-memory footprint OCI Container Runtime fully written in
C.

crun conforms to the OCI Container Runtime specifications
(<https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec>).

## Documentation

The user documentation is available [here](crun.1.md).

## Why another implementation?

While most of the tools used in the Linux containers ecosystem are
written in Go, I believe C is a better fit for a lower level tool like a
container runtime. runc, the most used implementation of the OCI runtime
specs written in Go, re-execs itself and use a module written in C for
setting up the environment before the container process starts.

crun aims to be also usable as a library that can be easily included in
programs without requiring an external process for managing OCI

## Goal

The Rust CUDA Project is a project aimed at making Rust a tier-1 language for extremely fast GPU computing
using the CUDA Toolkit. It provides tools for compiling Rust to extremely fast PTX code as well as libraries
for using existing CUDA libraries with it.

## Background

Historically, general purpose high performance GPU computing has been done using the CUDA toolkit. The CUDA toolkit primarily
provides a way to use Fortran/C/C++ code for GPU computing in tandem with CPU code with a single source. It also provides

femtoGPT is a pure Rust implementation of a minimal Generative Pretrained Transformer.

It can be used for both *inference* and *training* of GPT-style language-models
using **CPUs** and **GPUs**!

🥳 ***We are happy to announce that [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/) is sponsoring GPU resources to help the development of this project!*** 🤝

## Intro

Everything is implemented from scratch, including the tensor processing logic
along with training/inference code of a minimal GPT architecture.

The architecture is very similar/almost identical with Andrej Karpathy's
[nanoGPT video lecture](https://github.com/karpathy/ng-video-lecture).

femtoGPT is a great start for those who are fascinated by LLMs and would like to
understand how these models work in very deep levels.

femtoGPT uses nothing but random generation libraries (`rand`/`rand-distr`), data-serialization

Legend-State is a super fast and powerful state library for JavaScript apps with four primary goals:

### 1. <span className=""text-lg"">🦄</span> As easy as possible to use

There is no boilerplate and there are no contexts, actions, reducers, dispatchers, sagas, thunks, or epics. It doesn't modify your data at all, and you can just call `get()` to get the raw data and `set()` to change it.

In React components you can call `use()` on any observable to get the raw data and automatically re-render whenever it changes.

```jsx
// Create an observable object
const state$ = observable({ settings: { theme: 'dark' } })

// Just get and set
const theme = state$.settings.theme.get();
state$.settings.theme.set('light')

// observe re-runs when accessed observables change
observe(() => {
    console.log(state$.settings.theme.get())
})

const Component = function Component() {
    // use() makes this component re-render whenever it changes
    const theme = state$.settings.theme.use()

    return <div>Theme: {theme}</div>

# Cognitive Load Developer's Handbook

## Introduction
We spend far more time reading and understanding code than writing it. Therefore, the amount of cognitive load required to understand code is a crucial metric.

## Cognitive load
> **Cognitive load is how much a developer needs to know in order to complete a task.** Higher cognitive load means that developers have to spend more time learning the required information.

We should strive to reduce the cognitive load in our projects as much as possible.

The average person can hold roughly [four unrelated facts](https://github.com/zakirullin/cognitive-load/issues/16) in working memory. Once the cognitive load reaches this threshold, a significant effort is required to understand things.

*Let's say we have been asked to make some fixes to a completely unfamiliar project. We were told that a really smart developer had contributed to it. Lots of cool architectures, fancy libraries and trendy technologies were used. In other words, **the previous author had created a high co",Developer Tools,"['Managing cognitive load while developing', 'Finding resources to reduce cognitive load', 'Improving cognitive performance and focus']","{

fastgron," High-performance JSON to GRON (greppable, flattened JSON) converter",https://github.com/adamritter/fastgron,2023-05-27T19:00:45Z,2023-10-24T06:08:09Z,C++,357,6,"# fastgron

Make JSON greppable super fast!

fastgron transforms JSON into discrete assignments to make it easier to grep for what you want and see the absolute 'path' to it. It eases the exploration of APIs that return large blobs of JSON but have terrible documentation.

`fastgron` is a high-performance JSON to GRON converter, developed in C++20, utilizing simdjson library.
It's 50x faster than [gron](https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron) on big files (400MB/s input / 1.8GB/s output on M1 Macbook Pro), so it makes big JSON files greppable.

```bash
> fastgron ""https://api.github.com/repos/adamritter/fastgron/commits?per_page=1"" | fgrep commit.author
json[0].commit.author = {}
json[0].commit.author.name = ""adamritter""
json[0].commit.author.email = ""58403584+adamritter@users.noreply.github.com""
json[0].commit.author.date = ""2023-05-30T18:04:25Z""
```

fastgron can work backwards too, enabling you to turn your filtered data back into JSON:

```bash
> fastgron ""https://api.github.com/repos/adamritter/fastgron/commits?per_page=1"" | fgrep commit.author | fastgron --ungron

# Harmonic for Hacker News

Harmonic for Hacker News is an Android Hacker News client which is meant to be modern, fast and well thought out. You can find it on Google Play for download.

This has been my personal side project since 2020 and since starting my PhD in 2021 the time I have to dedicate to Harmonic has decreased. My personal philosophy on side projects is that the most important thing is building something that is actually shipped. Since much of my knowledge on building Android apps is ~10 years old, Harmonic does not use Kotlin or the latest Android API's and is probably not the easiest app to dig into the source code of. However, it is shipped, and it works fairly well in my opinion at least. :)

The purpose of open-sourcing Harmonic is thus mainly to enable interested users to submit pull requests fixing issues or adding features. I would like to still be able to find my way around the app's code so I am not looking for a full Kotlin re",Mobile Development,"{'Problem 1': 'Allows users to browse and read articles from Hacker News on their Android devices', 'Problem 2': 'Enables users to view and interact with comments and discussions on Hacker News', 'Problem 3': 'Provides a modern and intuitive user interface for a better reading experience on Hacker News'}","{""Category"": ""Mobile Development"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Allows users to browse and read articles from Hacker News on their Android devices"", ""Problem 2"": ""Enables users to view and interact with comments and discussions on Hacker News"", ""Problem 3"": ""Provides a modern and intuitive user interface for a better reading experience on Hacker News""}}"

It's powered by [GJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson) and [SJSON](https://github.com/tidwall/sjson) under the hood. 

It's [fast](#performance) because it avoids parsing irrelevant sections of json, skipping over values that do not apply, and aborts as soon as the target value has been found or updated.

Getting started
---------------

## Install

### Mac (Homebrew)

```
brew install tidwall/jj/jj
```

### Build

```
make
```

Or [download a pre-built binary](https://github.com/tidwall/jj/releases) for Linux, OSX, Windows, or FreeBSD.


### Usage

```
$ jj -h

usage: jj [-v value] [-purOD] [-i infile] [-o outfile] keypath

examples: jj keypath                      read value from stdin
      or: jj -i infile keypath            read value from infile
      or: jj -v value keypath             edit value

# Trogon

Auto-generate friendly terminal user interfaces for command line apps.

Trogon works with the popular [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/) library for Python, but will support other libraries and languages in the future.

## How it works

Trogon inspects your (command line) app and extracts a *schema* which describes the options / switches / help etc.
It then uses that information to build a [Textual](https://github.com/textualize/textual) UI you can use to edit and run the command.

[Plan 9](https://plan9.io/plan9/) in Rust

R9 is a reimplementation of the plan9 kernel in Rust.  It is
not only inspired by but in many ways derived from the original
[Plan 9](https://plan9.io/plan9/) source code.

## Building

We use `cargo` and the `xtask` pattern to build the kernel.

To build r9 for x86_64, we assume you have cloned the git repository
somewhere convenient.  Then simply change into the top-level
directory and, `cargo xtask build --arch x86-64`.

To build for aarch64, run `cargo xtask build --arch aarch64` (Currently only Raspberry Pi 3 is supported).

There are other useful `xtask` subcommands; run
`cargo xtask help` to see what is available.

Right now, r9 is not self-hosting.

## Runtime Dependencies

`cargo xtask dist`, which `cargo xtask qemu` and 
`cargo xtask qemukvm` depend on, requires `llvm-objcopy`. 
This is expected to live in the rust toolchain path.  You can install by running:
```
rustup component add llvm-tools
```

If you get `No such file or directory (os error 2)` messages, 
then install `llvm` separate from the rust toolchain and se",Operating Systems,"['Improving performance and efficiency of the R9 operating system', 'Enhancing security features of the R9 operating system', 'Adding new functionalities and features to the R9 operating system']","{""Category"": ""Operating Systems"", ""Problems"": [""Improving performance and efficiency of the R9 operating system"", ""Enhancing security features of the R9 operating system"", ""Adding new functionalities and features to the R9 operating system""]}"

Abstract
--------

This is a simple terminal multiplexing utility for Node.js
environments. It is inspired by the awesome and unreachable
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) native Unix utility. The stmux utility
is intended to provide just a very tiny subset of the original
[tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) functionality, but in a portable way for
bare Node.js environments and with some special features for application
build environments. Most notably, stmux has a built-time error
detection and notification feature, can automatically restart terminated commands,
and can automatically close or wait after all spawned commands have
successfully or unsuccessfully terminated.

Internally, stmux is based on the awesome
[Blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) screen rendering environment
and emulates full XTerm-compatible pseudo-terminals
to the spawned programs with the help of [Blessed XTerm](https://gith",Terminal Utilities,"{'Problem 1': 'Managing multiple terminal sessions in a Node.js environment', 'Problem 2': 'Organizing and controlling output from multiple processes in a terminal', 'Problem 3': 'Interacting with multiple processes simultaneously in a terminal'}","{

This is a very simple re-implementation of [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain), in ~100 lines of code. In essence, it is an LLM (GPT-3.5) powered chat application that is able to use tools (Google search and a calculator) in order to hold conversations and answer questions. 

Here's an example:

~~~
Q: What is the world record for solving a rubiks cube?
The world record for solving a Rubik's Cube is 4.69 seconds, held by Yiheng Wang (China).
Q: Can a robot solve it faster?
The fastest time a robot has solved a Rubik's Cube is 0.637 seconds.
Q: Who made this robot?
Infineon created the robot that solved a Rubik's Cube in 0.637 seconds.
Q: What time would an average human expect for solving?
It takes the average person about three hours to solve a Rubik's cube for the first time.
~~~

This is not intended to be a replacement for LangChain, instead it was built for fun and educational purposes. If you're interested in how LangChain, and similar tools work, this is a good starting point.

## Features

Large Language Models (LLMs) based AI bots are amazing. However, their behavior can be random and different bots excel at different tasks. If you want the best experience, don't try them one by one. ChatALL (Chinese name: 齐叨) can send prompt to several AI bots concurrently, help you to discover the best results. All you need to do is [download, install](https://github.com/sunner/ChatALL/releases) and ask.

### Is this you?

## Generative Agents for video games
Generative agents are virtual characters that can store memories and dynamically react to their environment. Using LLM models such as ChatGPT agents are able to observe their surroundings, store memories, and react to state changes in the world

Generative Agents save time programming interactions by hand and make NPC's more realistic / dynamic

## Getting Started
Create new agents (as in the example project) [example project](/example/javascript/smallville.js)

Supported Client Languages: Java, JavaScript (or use the http endpoints)

## How was it made?

[![current map](public/current-map.png)](https://anvaka.github.io/map-of-github/)

The first step was to fetch who gave stars to which repositories. For this I used a public data set of github activity events on 
Google BigQuery, considering only events between Jan 2020 and March 2023. This gave me more than 350 million stars.
(Side note: Mind blowing to think that Milky Way has more than 100 billion stars)

In the second phase I computed exact [Jaccard Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) between each repository. 
For my home computer's 24GB RAM this was too much, however an AWS EC2 instance with 512GB of RAM chewed through it in a few hours.

Are you tired of rewriting fizz buzz at every job interview, then this
package is for you. 

Just build the Docker container and run it on your favorite platform, 
and you now have a REST-api that should give you the results, you'll need.

    $ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/fizzbuzz/135 

    $ {""result"":""FizzBuzz""}%  

To parse the result you could use jq  to remove that unused information like this:

    $ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/fizzbuzz/15 -s | jq -r .result

## Installation

You'll need a system with leiningen and Docker installed

To build to docker container just run make with:

    $ make uberjar build

Which should build the docker container called fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.

## Usage

You can start the docker container on your own computer with

    $ docker run -dp 3000:3000 fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz

To test that it works, try to call the service with curl, or
another web-client:

    $ curl 127.0.0.1:3000/fizzbuzz/12    

## Examples

I have included a test shell script that will query the api 200 times, and write the results
to the screen.

    $ ./fizzbuzz.sh

Script-server is a Web UI for scripts.  

As an administrator, you add your existing scripts into Script server and other users would be able to execute them via a web interface.
The UI is very straightforward and can be used by non-tech people.

No script modifications are needed - you configure each script in Script server and it creates the corresponding UI with parameters and takes care of validation, execution, etc.  

[DEMO server](https://script-server.net/)

[Admin interface screenshots](https://github.com/bugy/script-server/wiki/Admin-interface)

## Features
- Different types of script parameters (text, flag, dropdown, file upload, etc.)
- Real-time script output
- Users can send input during script execution
- Auth (optional): LDAP, Google OAuth, htpasswd file
- Access control
- Alerts

Promptr is a CLI tool that lets you use plain English to instruct GPT3 or GPT4 to make changes to your codebase. This is most effective with GPT4 because of its larger context window, but GPT3 is still useful for smaller scopes. 
<br /><br />

The PR's below are good examples of what can be accomplished using Promptr. You can find links to the individual commits and the prompts that created them in the PR descriptions.
- https://github.com/ferrislucas/promptr/pull/38
- https://github.com/ferrislucas/promptr/pull/41
<br /><br />

I've found this to be a good workflow:
- Commit any changes, so you have a clean working area.
- Author your prompt in a text file. The prompt should be specific clear instructions. 
- Make sure your prompt contains the relative paths of any files that are relevant to your instructions. 
- Use Promptr to execute your prompt. Provide the path to your prompt file using the `-p` option: 
`promptr -p my_prompt.txt` 
*If you have access to GPT4 then use the `-m gpt4` option to get the best results.*

> A CRDT framework with a powerful abstraction of shared data

Yjs is a [CRDT implementation](#Yjs-CRDT-Algorithm) that exposes its internal
data structure as *shared types*. Shared types are common data types like `Map`
or `Array` with superpowers: changes are automatically distributed to other
peers and merged without merge conflicts.

Yjs is **network agnostic** (p2p!), supports many existing **rich text
editors**, **offline editing**, **version snapshots**, **undo/redo** and
**shared cursors**. It scales well with an unlimited number of users and is well
suited for even large documents.

### IceCream — Never use print() to debug again

Do you ever use `print()` or `log()` to debug your code? Of course you
do. IceCream, or `ic` for short, makes print debugging a little sweeter.

`ic()` is like `print()`, but better:

  1. It prints both expressions/variable names and their values.
  2. It's 60% faster to type.
  3. Data structures are pretty printed.
  4. Output is syntax highlighted.
  5. It optionally includes program context: filename, line number, and
     parent function.

IceCream is well tested, [permiss",Development Tools,"['Debugging code efficiently', 'Eliminating the need for print statements', 'Improving code readability by using a visual debugger']","{""Category"": ""Development Tools"", ""Problems"": [""Debugging code efficiently"", ""Eliminating the need for print statements"", ""Improving code readability by using a visual debugger""]}"

### Problem: Getting models to output structured JSON is hard

### Solution: Only generate the content tokens and fill in the fixed tokens

[![colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/1rgs/jsonformer/blob/main/Jsonformer_example.ipynb)

![cover](img/cover4.png)

Generating structured JSON from language models is a challenging task. The
generated JSON must be syntactically correct, and it must conform to a schema
that specifies the structure of the JSON.

Current approaches to this problem are brittle and error-prone. They rely on prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and post-processing, but they still fail to generate syntactically correct JSON in many cases.

Jsonformer is a new approach to this problem. In structured data, many tokens are fixed and predictable. Jsonformer is a wrapper around Hugging Face models that fills in the fixed tokens during the generation process, and only delegates the generation of content tokens to the language model. This makes it more",Data Processing,"['1. Generating structured JSON data from language models', '2. Ensuring the generated JSON is valid and error-free', '3.

An open source development environment (tooling, headers, examples) for the [CH32V003](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32V003.html) with gcc-riscv64 that can be used in Windows (Native), Linux and/or WSL.  The CH32V003 is 10-cent part with a RISC-V EC core that runs at 48MHz, has 16kB of flash and 2kB of RAM and a bunch of peripherals.  It also comes in SOP-8, QFN-20 and SOIC packages.  You can get the datasheet [here](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH32V003DS0_PDF.html).

The goal of this project is to develop the tooling and environment for efficient use of the CH32V003.  Avoid complicated HALs, and unleash the hardware! The existing EVT is massive, and dev environment weighty.  This project specifically avoids the HAL and makes it so you can just use the [TRM](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH32V003RM_PDF.html).

## Self-extracting GPT prompts for ~70% token savings

Check out the accompanying blog post [here](https://musings.yasyf.com/compressgpt-decrease-token-usage-by-70/).

### Installation

```shell
$ pip install compress-gpt
```

### Usage

Simply change your existing imports of `langchain.PromptTemplate` to `compress_gpt.langchain.CompressTemplate` (to compress prompts before populating variables) or `compress_gpt.langchain.CompressPrompt` (to compress prompts after populating variables).

```diff
-from langchain import PromptTemplate
+from compress_gpt.langchain import CompressPrompt as PromptTemplate
```

For very simple prompts, use `CompressSimplePrompt` and `CompressSimpleTemplate` instead.

If compression ever fails or results in extra tokens, the original prompt will be used. Each compression result is aggressively cached, but the first run can take a hot sec.

#### Clearing the cache

```python
import compress_gpt

compress_gpt.clear_cache()
```

**deep**doctection is a Python library that orchestrates document extraction and document layout analysis tasks using deep learning models. It does 
not implement models but enables you to build pipelines using highly acknowledged libraries for object detection, OCR 
and selected NLP tasks and provides an integrated framework for fine-tuning, evaluating and running models. For more
 specific text processing tasks use one of the many other great NLP libraries.

**deep**doctection focuses on applications and is made for those who want to solve real world problems related to 
document extraction from PDFs or scans in various image formats.

Check the demo of a document layout analysis pipeline with OCR on 
:hugs: [**Hugging Face spaces**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/deepdoctection/deepdoctection).

Rye is [Armin's](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/) personal one-stop-shop for all
his Python needs. It installs and manages Python installations, manages
`pyproject.toml` files, installs and uninstalls dependencies, manages
virtualenvs behind the scenes. It supports monorepos and global tool
installations.

It is a wish of what Python was, with no guarantee to work for anyone else. It's
an exploration, and it's far from perfect. Thus also the question:

question_extractor,Generate question/answer training pairs out of raw text.,https://github.com/nestordemeure/question_extractor,2023-04-18T20:59:39Z,2023-10-20T20:20:49Z,Python,145,11,"# Question Extractor 🧐

Large language models can be instruction tuned with a set of questions and answers.
However, to further fine-tune a model *on your own data*, you need a large number of questions and answers about your data.
Producing those questions and answers can be a lot of manual work.

This repository lets you use a non-fine-tuned language model (ChatGPT) to extract question/answer pairs automatically from existing textual data, eliminating all manual work.

## Installation

To run this code, you will need to clone this repository then install the following Python packages:

* `tiktoken`, the OpenAI tokeniser,
* `openai`, the official OpenAI API client,
* `langchain`, glue code used to combine models and utilities.

## Usage

This script is designed to turn a folder of markdown (`.md`) documents into a `.json` file containing a list of questions, answers and paths to the source documents that were used to produce them.

To run the code, set the relevant file paths in the `question_extractor.py` file (both the input folder and the output path) and insure that your [OpenAI API key](https://plat",Natural Language Processing,"['Training question/answer generation models', 'Creating datasets for question answering tasks', 'Automating the process of generating question/answer pairs']","{""Category"": ""Natural Language Processing"", ""Problems"": [""Training question/answer generation models"", ""Creating datasets for question answering tasks"", ""Automating the process of generating question/answer pairs""]}"

> ⚠️💀 **WARNING** 💀⚠️:
> Always examine the code of any plugin you use thoroughly, as plugins can execute any Python code, leading to potential malicious activities such as stealing your API keys.

> ⚙️ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ⚙️:

## New in Auto-GPT 0.4.1
- Unzipped plugins are now supported! You can now clone or download plugins directly from GitHub and place them in the `plugins` directory without zipping, as long as they are in the correct (NEW) format.
- Plugins settings have been moved out of the `.env` file to a new `plugins_config.yaml` file in the root directory of Auto-GPT.
- `ALLOWLISTED_PLUGINS` and `DENYLISTED_PLUGINS` `.env` settings are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
- Plugins must now be explicitly enabled in plugins. See the [installation](#installation) section for more details.

Ehrlich means ""honest"" in german, and it also happens to be my last name. This project is 100% for fun, so try not to take it too seriously.

This is a discord bot that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses to messages in a discord server.

It has several interesting features:
* Modifies its own prompt based on the context of the conversation
* Progressively summarized short term memory
* Long term memory summarization and storage
* Embedding based long term memory lookup
* Rudimentary ability to search the web for information
* gpt-4 support

TODOs (also see [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)):
* Voice integration
* DALL-E integration
* Come up with a more objective way to measure progress improving the prompt

## The Good

![EhrlichGPT doing well](./demo/good.png)

I'm calling this good because the recollection went well. gpt-3.5-turbo still hallucinated that Aaron Burr was president, but that really is what we'd talked about before. It successfully looked up the weather from the internet a couple of times, but then came to the wrong conclusion about the temperature.

DoctorGPT brings GPT into production for error diagnosing!
(Not production ready, yet...)

DoctorGPT is a lightweight self-contained binary that monitors your application logs for problems and diagnoses them.

## Usage
`OPENAI_KEY=$YOUR_KEY doctorgpt --logfile=""program.log"" --configfile=""config.yaml"" --outdir=""~/errors""`

DoctorGPT will start tailing `program.log` (without stopping). For each log line, user-defined parsers triggering a diagnosis event (based on regex variable matches) will generate a diagnosis file (see example below) under directory `~/errors` using the triggered log line and all previous log context using the OpenAI API. `config.yaml` file is used at startup to configure the program.

## CLI flags
- `--logfile (string)` log file to tail and monitor
- `--configfile (string)` yaml config file location
- `--outdir (string)` diagnosis files directory (created if it does not exist)
- `--bundlingtimeoutseconds (int)` wait some time for logs to come-in after the triggered line (for multi-line error dumps) (`default: 5`)
- `--debug (bool)` debug logging (`default: true`)

ChatGDB is a tool designed to superpower your debugging experience with GDB or LLDB, debuggers for compiled languages. Use it to accelerate your debugging workflow by leveraging the power of ChatGPT to assist you while using GDB/LLDB! 

It allows you to explain in natural language what you want to do, and then automatically execute the relevant command. Optionally, you can ask ChatGPT to explain the command it just ran or even pass in any question for it to answer. Focus on what's important - figuring out that nasty bug instead of chasing down GDB/LLDB commands at the tip of your tongue.

Cheetah leverages Whisper for real-time audio transcription and GPT-4 for generating hints and solutions. You need to have your own OpenAI API key to use the app. If you don't have access to GPT-4, gpt-3.5-turbo may be used as an alternative.

Whisper runs locally on your system, utilizing Georgi Gerganov's [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp). A recent M1 or M2 Mac is required for optimal performance.

llm_agents,Build agents which are controlled by LLMs,https://github.com/mpaepper/llm_agents,2023-04-04T21:25:35Z,2023-10-26T01:39:36Z,Python,813,47,"## LLM Agents

Small library to build agents which are controlled by large language models (LLMs) which is heavily inspired by <a href=""https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/"" target=""_blank"">langchain</a>.

The goal was to get a better grasp of how such an agent works and understand it all in very few lines of code.

Langchain is great, but it already has a few more files and abstraction layers, so I thought it would be nice to build the most important parts of a simple agent from scratch.

Some more infos are in <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35446171"">this Hacker News discussion from April 5th 2023</a> and the <a href=""https://www.paepper.com/blog/posts/intelligent-agents-guided-by-llms/"">related blog post</a>.

### How it works

The agent works like this:

* It gets instructed by a prompt which tells it the basic way to solve a task using tools
* Tools are custom build components which the agent can use
    * So far, I've implemented the ability to execute Python code in a REPL, to use the Google search and to search on Hacker News
* The agent runs in a loop of Thought, Action, Observatio",Artificial Intelligence,"{'1': 'Developing intelligent agents', '2': 'Enabling control of agents through LLMs', '3': 'Building automated systems using agent technology'}","{""Category"": ""Artificial Intelligence"", ""Problems"": {""1"": ""Developing intelligent agents"", ""2"": ""Enabling control of agents through LLMs"", ""3"": ""Building automated systems using agent technology""}}"

Because this bot is not meant for 1:1 copying, I will not provide a full README. I will provide a summary of what this bot contains.

There is infrastructure for chatting with openAI GPT using langchain and pinecone to create both short term and long term memories.

There is infrastructure for generating AI images using both Stable Diffusion and DALLE.

There is infrastructure for regularly checking RSS feeds of hackernews as well as several major mainstream media outlets, and posting them in discord.  

Futhermore, there is code for posting random items from a database on a cron schedule.

There are phrase generation functions (nsfw!).

There is a very convoluted bannedword.js file in which you can see my attempt to ban a phrase and reinvent the wheel on detecting leetspeak workarounds.

There are various examples of discord commands and mod tools, some of which are no longer necessary as Discord has built them in now.

## Alpha Factors 

Alpha factors are transformations of market, fundamental, and alternative data that contain predictive signals. They are designed to capture risks that drive asset returns. One set of factors describes fundamental, economy-wide variables such as growth, inflation, volatility, productivity, and demographic risk. Another set consists of tradeable investment styles such as the market portfolio, value-growth investing, and momentum investing.

### Details on the notebooks:
1. `feature_engineering_us.ipynb`  illustrates how to engineer basic factors using pandas and numpy.
2. `1_sample_selection.ipynb` selects top 500 stocks in terms of traded volume, which will be used subsequently for feature engineering.
3. `2_ta_alpha_factors.ipynb` illustrates the usage of TA-Lib, which includes a broad range of common technical indicators. These indicators have in common that they only use market data, i.e., price and volume information.

# social4git: Non-federated decentralized social media

Briefly, this is a decentralized version of Twitter that does not use federation.

Every user stores their application state in a git repo they own and control. No other infrastructure is necessary!

You use the application using a client. We have a command-line client for now.

## Install and use

All you need to do is read this short [walkthrough](doc/walkthrough.sh).

## You are not alone

We keep a [directory](doc/directory.md) of users who want to be followed. Feel free to grant their wish.

## Going forward

This is a proof-of-concept, but quite capable at it.

There's a lot we hope to materialize soon:
- mobile client
- liking
- verifiable posting
- track a Twitter timeline
- analytics
  - who are my followers
  - what is the impact of my posts

## Who's behind this

social4git is the little sister of [gov4git](https://github.com/gov4git/gov4git).

XState is a state management and orchestration solution for JavaScript and TypeScript apps.

It uses event-driven programming, state machines, statecharts, and the actor model to handle complex logic in predictable, robust, and visual ways. XState provides a powerful and flexible way to manage application and workflow state by allowing developers to model logic as actors and state machines.

`run-wild` extends [m1guelpf](https://github.com/m1guelpf)'s [browser-agent](https://github.com/m1guelpf/browser-agent) project by allowing gpt4 to alter it's goal. This is very dumb and probably ought not exist, but c'est la vie.

At it's core, `run-wild` bridges GPT-4 and a headless Chromium browser, automating actions as self-directed by it's goal. It takes the form of a Rust CLI, but also exports most of the internals as a library for others to use.

## Installation

`run-wild` is built using Rust, so you'll need to install the Rust toolchain. You can do this by following the instructions at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Once you have Rust installed, you can install `run-wild` by running:

```bash
cargo install run-wild
```

You should also place your OpenAI API key in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. This key should have access to the `gpt-4` model.

You can copy the contents of the `example.env` file to a `.env` file in the root of the project, and fill in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable. The `.env` file is ignored by git, so you don't have to worry about accidentally committing",Artificial Intelligence,"{'Problem 1': 'Enhancing GPT-4 environment access', 'Problem 2': 'Improving GPT-4 capabilities', 'Problem 3': 'Advancing natural language understanding'}","{""Category"": ""Artificial Intelligence"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Enhancing GPT-4 environment access"", ""Problem 2"": ""Improving GPT-4 capabilities"", ""Problem 3"": ""Advancing natural language understanding""}}"

You write an image filter function in Python that receives an image frame, transforms it, and returns a processed image frame.
**`streamlit-fesion` exports it to the frontend environment and executes it with [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) to process the WebCam video stream.**

Look at the code below. It is a grayscale filter example.

```python
from streamlit_fesion import streamlit_fesion


def image_filter(input_image):
    import skimage

    grayscale = skimage.color.rgb2gray(input_image)
    return skimage.color.gray2rgb(grayscale)


streamlit_fesion(image_filter, [], key=""fesion"")
```
`image_filter()` is the filter function.
`streamlit-fesion` will call it with an input image frame of type `np.ndarray` with 3 channels (RGB-ordered), and the filter function returns a processed image frame with the same type and shape.

###### `MAIS202` is an *introductory bootcamp to ML* that taught me the basics such as CNNs, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes and many more.

As a complementary to the bootcamp, here is a project I wanted to tackle: Emotion Detection in Faces using ML.

The goal is to identify what emotion a person is feeling by looking at a static pitcure or a real-time video of them. 

#### STEPS:
1) Started by reading the academic paper [DeepEmotion2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.01019.pdf),
2) Created my CNN and got stuck on how to convert numbers to images, how to localize faces, and how to make a live webcame demo.
3) Found out two implementation that went over the correct code
- [OmarSayed7's implementation of DeepEmotion2019](https://github.com/omarsayed7/Deep-Emotion)
- [DeepLearning_by_PhDScholar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN7qfBhfGqs&ab_channel=DeepLearning_by_PhDScholar)
4) Implemented and merged the two after understanding every class and function used. 

I followed [OmarSayed7's implementation of DeepEmotion2019](https://github.com/omarsayed7/Deep-Emotion) and b",Computer Vision,"['Real-time emotion recognition from facial expressions', 'Analyzing and understanding human emotions', 'Developing applications for emotion-based user interactions']","{

<!-- What is Fluke? -->
## What is Fluke?

Fluke is a Python package that acts as a higher-level API to
cloud services that primarily relate to object storage and
messaging. Fluke manages to hide away much of the complexity
that derives from working with said services, aiding you in
completing your tasks fast and hassle-free! Fluke achieves this by:

* Wrapping object storage services within a *File/Dir* API
  inspired by the more familiar file storage, through which
  you are able to interact with your data no matter where
  they reside, be it the local file system, a remote server,
  or a bucket in the cloud.

* Greatly reducing the intricacies of working with message
  queues by viewing them as mere data structures that support
  three elementary operations, that is, *push*, *peek*, and *poll*.

You can start using Fluke by installing it via pip.

</p>

Augraphy is a Python library that creates multiple copies of original documents though an augmentation pipeline that randomly distorts each copy -- degrading the clean version into dirty and realistic copies rendered through synthetic paper printing, faxing, scanning and copy machine processes.

Highly-configurable pipelines apply adjustments to the originals to create realistic old or noisy documents by acting as a factory, producing almost an infinite number of variations from their source.  This simulation of realistic paper-oriented process distortions can create large amounts of training data for AI/ML processes to learn how to remove those distortions.

Treatments applied by Augraphy fabricate realistic documents that appear to have been printed on dirty laser or inkjet printers, scanned by dirty office scanners, faxed by low-resolution fax machines and otherwise mistreated by real-world paper handling office equipment.

\* created using `create-react-app`

# Introduction

In this tutorial, I'll show you how you can create a React app and deploy it to GitHub Pages.

To create the React app, I'll be using [`create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/), which is a tool people can use to create a React app from scratch. To deploy the React app, I'll be using [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages), which is an npm package people can use to deploy things to [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), a free web hosting service provided by GitHub.

If you follow along with this tutorial, you'll end up with a new React app—hosted on GitHub Pages—which you can then customize.

# Tutorial

## Prerequisites

1. [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) are installed. Here are the versions I'll be using while making this tutorial:

    ```shell
    $ node --version
    v16.13.2

    $ npm --version
    8.1.2

Template is a simple JS framework for creating interactive applications.

It focuses on using web-native patterns.

Calling it a framework is a bit of an exaggeration, it's a single `class` that
manages HTML `<template>`s.

The entire ""framework"" is here: [./template.ts](./template.ts)

# Usage

```html
<!DOCTYPE >

  <h3>Full-stack type-safety with pure TypeScript</h3>
</div>

---

Phero is the no-hassle and type-safe glue between your backend and frontend. TypeScript is at the core of it all. Development with Phero goes in these steps:

1. **Build your backend.** Define your domain models and functions in regular, plain TypeScript.
2. **Run the CLI.** This runs the server and generates an SDK for your frontend, or multiple frontends at the same time.
3. **Call your backend-functions from the frontend, as if they were local.** This includes type-safety and error-handling.

This boosts your frontend development:

💪 Use functions and domain models on the frontend, defined on the backend.  
🧨 Handle errors on the frontend, thrown by the backend.  
🤝 Stop assuming data is of the type you’re expecting. You know it is, period.  
✅ No more mistakes with the specs of the API, like path, arguments or headers.

Backend development becomes a breeze as well:

Evals is a framework for evaluating LLMs (large language models) or systems built using LLMs as components. It also includes an open-source registry of challenging evals.

We now support evaluating the behavior of any system including prompt chains or tool-using agents, via the [Completion Function Protocol](docs/completion-fns.md).

With Evals, we aim to make it as simple as possible to build an eval while writing as little code as possible. An ""eval"" is a task used to evaluate the quality of a system's behavior.

To get set up with evals, follow the [setup instructions below](README.md#Setup). You can also run and create evals using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/openai-evals/reports/OpenAI-Evals-Demo-Using-W-B-Prompts-to-Run-Evaluations--Vmlldzo0MTI4ODA3).

#### Running evals
- Learn how to run existing evals: [run-evals.md](docs/run-evals.md).
- Familiarize yourself with the existing eval templates: [eval-templates.md](docs/eval-templates.md).

**:warning: 2023-03-16: [LLaMA is now supported in Huggingface `transformers`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/0041be5b3d1b9a5e1443e1825d7d80f6dfadcdaa), which has out-of-the-box int8 support. I'll keep this repo up as a means of space-efficiently testing LLaMA weights packaged as `state_dict`s, but for serious inference or training workloads I encourage users to migrate to `transformers`. Instructions for converting weights can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/llama).**

This is a fork of the LLaMA code that runs LLaMA-13B
comfortably within 24 GiB of RAM.
It relies almost entirely on the `bitsandbytes` and `LLM.int8()` work of Tim Dettmers.
I've tested it on an RTX 4090, and it [reportedly works on the 3090](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/issues/79#issuecomment-1454687232). It might also theoretically allow us to run LLaMA-65B on an 80GB A100, but I haven't tried this.

- Quantizes weights on the host machine

This was a little experiment that I (Thomas) created. 
My goal was a self sustaining program that could reproduce and mutate by using ChatGPT.
I wrote .gitignore, start.py, 0.py, and lib.py.

The code is 'supposed' to create a new file where the name is it's lineage.
0.py is the first, and 0.0.py is the first child of 0.py, 0.0.1 is the second child of 0.0.py etc.

Requests to ChatGPT are concurrent within an execution of get_children, but because of how I used exec() only a single version can be running at once.

It forms a tree, where if all of one version's children dies, then the next sibling (or aunt/uncle if the parent is exhausted too) is run. 

If you want to run this, I'd strongly encourage setting a cap on your OpenAI budget as this makes a lot of requests.

Learn-Vim,Learning Vim and Vimscript doesn't have to be hard. This is the guide that you're looking for 📖,https://github.com/iggredible/Learn-Vim,2020-07-13T13:27:44Z,2023-10-30T00:00:07Z,,12293,1003,"# Learn Vim (the Smart Way)

## What's This?

*Learn Vim (the Smart Way)* is a guide to learn the good parts of Vim.

There are many places to learn Vim: the `vimtutor` is a great place to start and the `help` manual has all the references you will ever need. However, the average user needs something more than `vimtutor` and less than the `help` manual. This guide attempts to bridge that gap by highlighting only the key features to learn the most useful parts of Vim in the least time possible.

This guide is written for both beginner and advanced Vimmers. It starts out with broad and simple concepts and ends with specific and advanced concepts. If you're an advanced user already, I would encourage you to read this guide from start to finish anyway, because you will learn something new!

FlexGen is a high-throughput generation engine for running large language models with limited GPU memory. FlexGen allows **high-throughput** generation by IO-efficient offloading, compression, and **large effective batch sizes**.

## Motivation

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown great performance across a 
wide range of tasks. Increasingly, LLMs have been applied not only to interactive 
applications (such as chat), but also to many ""back-of-house"" tasks.
These tasks include benchmarking, information extraction, data wrangling, and form processing.

One key characteristic of these applications is that they are **throughput-oriented**: they require
running LLM inferences over millions of tokens in batches, e.g., all the private documents in a company's
corpus, or all the tasks in the [HELM](https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/latest/) benchmark.
These workloads are less sensitive to latency - the user starts up a job and lets it run overnight -

## Introduction

[SHAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874) (SHapley Additive exPlanation) values are one of the leading tools for interpreting machine learning models. Even though computing SHAP values takes exponential time in general, TreeSHAP takes polynomial time on tree-based models (e.g., decision trees, random forest, gradient boos",Machine Learning,"['Interpreting tree-based models', 'Fast computation of SHAP values', 'Tree model explainability']","{""Category"": ""Machine Learning"", ""Problems"": [""Interpreting tree-based models"", ""Fast computation of SHAP values"", ""Tree model explainability""]}"

This is a tiny demo application which demonstrates the Amazon AWS 'Rekognition' face and image recognition API, as well as the 'Polly' speech synthesis API.

It uses the JPEG Camera library to take a photo from your PC/device onboard camera and send the facial data to Amazon for comparison and identification.

Full blog post about this project is here: http://devan.blaze.com.au/blog/2017/3/13/building-a-face-recognition-app-in-less-than-an-hour

## Prerequisites

You will need Ruby installed on your development machine *(Note: NOT Ruby on Rails, just plain Ruby language)*.  This app uses the light weight Sinatra framework to do all the back end heavy lifting.

Before running this web app, you will need to set up a .env file in the project folder with your Amazon IAM key and secret (as per the blog post above).

```
export AWS_KEY=<your IAM key here>
export AWS_SECRET=<your IAM secret here>
```

If you are using Linux/OS X, then you can just run the above commands in your terminal or shell to set up the environment variables.

prompt-engine,A library for helping developers craft prompts for Large Language Models,https://github.com/microsoft/prompt-engine,2022-06-17T17:48:19Z,2023-10-29T10:47:06Z,TypeScript,2263,88,"# Prompt Engine

This repo contains an NPM utility library for creating and maintaining prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Background

LLMs like GPT-3 and Codex have continued to push the bounds of what AI is capable of - they can capably generate language and code, but are also capable of emergent behavior like question answering, summarization, classification and dialog. One of the best techniques for enabling specific behavior out of LLMs is called prompt engineering - crafting inputs that coax the model to produce certain kinds of outputs. Few-shot prompting is the discipline of giving examples of inputs and outputs, such that the model has a reference for the type of output you're looking for.

Prompt engineering can be as simple as formatting a question and passing it to the model, but it can also get quite complex - requiring substantial code to manipulate and update strings. This library aims to make that easier. It also aims to codify patterns and practices around prompt engineering.

hyrule,a proof of concept rules evaluation engine,https://github.com/jhgg/hyrule,2019-01-28T01:15:24Z,2023-02-13T07:44:54Z,Python,6,1,"# hyrule
a proof of concept rules evaluation engine

## Project Status

This project is just me messing around with various ways a rules evaluation engine might work in Python.

## Concepts

In order to understand how Hyrule works, you need to understand a few concepts:
 - **Entity** An entity represents an object within Hyrule that has some significance in an external system. An enitity is defined by its `type` and `id`. A basic entity is a `User` (that is the type) and the user's id. 
 - **Label** An entity can have many labels attached to it. These labels are attached either by an operator, or by a the automated rules within Hyrule.
 - **Rule** A rule evaluates some preconditions and takes actions.
 - **Action** An action represents an intent to mutate labels attached to an Entity, along with the reason as to why the mutation is happening.

With the combination of entities, labels, rules and actions, we can build upon this a novel event classification system that can be used to enforce constraints, and detect bad actors within a system.

## An example

Let's suppose that we're managing an internet forum, ",Rules Engine,"{'Problem 1': 'Automating complex rule evaluation', 'Problem 2': 'Implementing rule-based decision making', 'Problem 3': 'Creating a proof of concept for rule evaluation'}","{""Category"": ""Rules Engine"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Automating complex rule evaluation"", ""Problem 2"": ""Implementing rule-based decision making"", ""Problem 3"": ""Creating a proof of concept for rule evaluation""}}"

### Natural Language → Knowledge Graph

![demo](demo.gif)

*Note: this is a toy project I built out over a weekend. If you want to use knowledge graphs in your project, check out [GPT Index](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index).*

GraphGPT converts unstructured natural language into a knowledge graph. Pass in the synopsis of your favorite movie, a passage from a confusing Wikipedia page, or transcript from a video to generate a graph visualization of entities and their relationships. 

Successive queries can update the existing state of the graph or create an entirely new structure. For example, updating the current state could involve injecting new information through nodes and edges or changing the color of certain nodes.

The current few-shot prompt guides GPT-3 in accurately understanding the JSON formatting GraphGPT requires for proper rendering. You can see the entire prompt in `public/prompts/main.prompt`. A major issue at the moment is latency. Due to the nature of OpenAI API calls, it takes up to 20 seconds to receive a response.

miniredis,A very tiny clone of Redis for experimenting with PubSub,https://github.com/rcarmo/miniredis,2012-06-21T09:50:36Z,2023-08-21T11:25:01Z,Python,43,0,"# `miniredis`

`miniredis` is a pure Python server that supports a subset of the redis protocol.

## Why?

The original intent was to have a minimally working (if naïve) PubSub implementation in order to get to grips with the [protocol spec](http://redis.io/topics/protocol), but I eventually realised that a more complete server would be useful for testing and inclusion in some of my projects.

## Performance

Extremely dependent on Python runtime and workload, of course. Your mileage may vary.

## Credits

I started out by forking [coderanger/miniredis](https://github.com/coderanger/miniredis) for experimentation, and things kind of accreted from there as I started implementing more commands.",Database,"['Implementing a lightweight PubSub messaging system', 'Experimenting with Redis functionality in a smaller scale', 'Testing and debugging Redis functionality in isolation']","{

GPTZero is an AI model with some mathematical formulation to determine if a particular text fed to it is written by AI or a human being.

## The motivation for it

Recently, GPTZero gotten a lot of hype/traction from media to be able to determine whether a set of sentences are generated from ChatGPT. It was indeed a great initative for Education Institutes. However, the implementation is closed-source. We tried to construct identical solutioning and voila!! :tada: our implementation gets the exact same results mostly lol. :joy: :joy: :joy:

collabuml,A collaborative UML editor; build with etherpad and plantuml,https://github.com/AlexITC/collabuml,2023-01-28T04:34:41Z,2023-07-16T12:32:41Z,JavaScript,167,3,"# Getting started

CollabUML is a PlantUML based app for online collaborative design on UML


## How it works?

CollabUML is a super-simple client only app that wires existing technology, in this case, it uses an https://etherpad.org to handle the collaborative text editor and https://plantuml.com/ public server to render the editor's content.

There is a timer that takes the etherpad content to render it with plantuml on every tick.


## Run it

An Etherpad instance is required, host/apikey must be configured at [config.js](./src/config.js)

Then, run `npm install` to download the js dependencies, then, `npm run start` will allow you to use the app at `localhost:8080`

## Project state

The project was created in 2020, there haven't been much changes since then, I plan to keep the server running for as long as it doesn't require much maintenance (the case for 3 years).

_Your wishes are my commands._

Shell Genie is a command-line tool that lets you interact with the terminal in plain English. You ask the genie what you want to do and it will give you the command you need.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Shell Genie is using [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

1. Install Python 3.10 or higher.
2. Install [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx#install-pipx).
3. Install Shell Genie: `pipx install shell-genie`

Alternatively, you can install it using pip:

1. Install Python 3.10 or higher.
2. Create a virtual environment in your preferred location: `python -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install Shell Genie: `pip install shell-genie`

## How to use

1. First, you need to initialize the tool by running the following command:

   ```shell
   shell-genie init
   ```

   This will prompt you to select a backend (either `openai-gpt3.5-turbo` or `free-genie`) and provide any additional information that is required (e.g. your own [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) key for `openai-gpt3.",Utilities,"{'Problem 1': 'Automating shell commands', 'Problem 2': 'Generating shell scripts', 'Problem 3': 'Executing shell commands'}","{""Category"": ""Utilities"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Automating shell commands"", ""Problem 2"": ""Generating shell scripts"", ""Problem 3"": ""Executing shell commands""}}"

🧐 Automatisch is a business automation tool that lets you connect different services like Twitter, Slack, and more to automate your business processes.

💸 Automating your workflows doesn't have to be a difficult or expensive process. You also don't need any programming knowledge to use Automatisch.

## Advantages

There are other existing solutions in the market, like Zapier and Integromat, so you might be wondering why you should use Automatisch.

✅ One of the main benefits of using Automatisch is that it allows you to store your data on your own servers, which is essential for businesses that handle sensitive user information and cannot risk sharing it with external cloud services. This is especially relevant for industries such as healthcare and finance, as well as for European companies that must adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## Neural Networks: Zero to Hero

A course on neural networks that starts all the way at the basics. The course is a series of YouTube videos where we code and train neural networks together. The Jupyter notebooks we build in the videos are then captured here inside the [lectures](lectures/) directory. Every lecture also has a set of exercises included in the video description. (This may grow into something more respectable).

**Lecture 1: The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd**

Backpropagation and training of neural networks. Assumes basic knowledge of Python and a vague recollection of calculus from high school.

# Plash

Build and run layered root filesystems.


## Install
```
cd $(mktemp -d)
git clone git@github.com:ihucos/plash.git .
make
sudo cp dist/plash /usr/local/bin
```

## Uninstall
```
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/plash
```

## Requirements
  - `make` and `cc`
  - Linux Kernel >= 5.11
  - Optional `newuidmap` and `newgidmap` for setuid/setgid support with non-root users (needed by e.G. `apt`)

## Documentation
```plash --from alpine --apk xeyes -- xeyes```

https://ihucos.github.io/plash-docs-deploy/


## Caveats

- Plash processes have the same operating system access rights than the process
  that started it. There is no security relevant isolation feature. Exactly as
  with running programs ""normally"", don't run programs you do not trust with
  plash and try to avoid using plash with the root user.

- Plash only runs inside Docker containers started with the `--privileged`
  flag, see GitHub issue #51 for details.

## Abstract

> In this paper, we present Msanii, a novel diffusion-based model for synthesizing long-context, high-fidelity music efficiently. Our model combines the expressiveness of mel spectrograms, the generative capabilities of diffusion models, and the vocoding capabilities of neural vocoders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Msanii by synthesizing tens of seconds (_190 seconds_) of _stereo_ music at high samp",Artificial Intelligence,"{'Problem 1': 'Generating long-context, high-fidelity music', 'Problem 2': 'Efficiently synthesizing music', 'Problem 3': 'Applying a diffusion-based model for music synthesis'}","{""Category"": ""Artificial Intelligence"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Generating long-context, high-fidelity music"", ""Problem 2"": ""Efficiently synthesizing music"", ""Problem 3"": ""Applying a diffusion-based model for music synthesis""}}"

Bring some old-school fun to your terminal! Explore the dungeon and shoot monsters in this pseudo-3D game inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D and Doom.

![Screenshot](screenshot.png)

# Running the game
`gawk -f awkaster.awk`

You need `gawk` version >= `4.0.0`


OS X users must install `gawk` first. The easiest way to do this is to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Once it has been installed, run the following commands:
```
brew update
brew install gawk
```

NetBSD users require `gawk`. The easiest way to do it is install it with [pkgin](http://pkgin.net):
```
pkgin install gawk
```

Alternatively install from sources using the [pkgsrc framework](https://pkgsrc.org/):
```
cd /usr/pkgsrc/lang/gawk && make install
```


OpenBSD users require `gawk`. The easiest way to do it is install it with [pkg_add](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/pkg_add.1):
```
pkg_add gawk
```

Alternatively install from sources using the [OpenBSD ports](http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-current/man1/ports.7):
```
cd /usr/ports/lang/gawk && make install clean
```
Your machine will now be ready to run *awkaster*.

frawk is a small programming language for writing short programs processing
textual data. To a first approximation, it is an implementation of the
[AWK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) language; many common Awk programs
produce equivalent output when passed to frawk. You might be interested in frawk
if you want your scripts to handle escaped CSV/TSV like standard Awk fields, or
if you want your scripts to execute faster.

  <h2>Trace your python process line by line with low overhead!</h2>
</div>

_beetrace_ allows you to trace a Python process line by line or the functions' entries
and returns. It uses USDT(User Statically-Defined Tracing) probes with
[bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/).

## Dependencies

- This package is only available for Linux and requires bpftrace. You can look at the
  bpftrace installation
  [here](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

- CPython must be
  [configured with the --with-dtrace option](https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html#cmdoption-with-dtrace).

## Installation

```bash
pip install beetrace
```

## Usage & Example

To trace the Python process, use the -p parameter to pass the pid value.

```bash
beetrace -p {pid of process}
```

Let's take a look at the quick example.

# Description
CTL is a lightweight Python library that offers you a convenient way to parse sentences into <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_(linguistics)"">constituent trees</a>, modify them according to their structure, as well as visualize and export them into various [file formats](#Export_visualization). In addition, you can extract phrases according to their phrasal categories (which can be used e.g., as features for various NLP tasks), validate already parsed sentences in bracket notation or convert them back into sentences. 

CTL is built on top of <a href=""https://github.com/nikitakit/self-attentive-parser"">**benepar**</a> (*Berkeley Neural Parser*) as well as the two well-known NLP frameworks <a href=""https://spacy.io"">**spaCy**</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/nltk/nltk"">**NLTK**</a>. Here, spaCy is used for tokenization and sentence segmentation, whil",Natural Language Processing,"['Parsing and analyzing natural language sentences', 'Building and visualizing constituent trees', 'Processing linguistic syntactic structures']","{""Category"": ""Natural Language Processing"", ""Problems"": [""Parsing and analyzing natural language sentences"", ""Building and visualizing constituent trees"", ""Processing linguistic syntactic structures""]}"

## What is *balance*?

**[*balance*](https://import-balance.org/) is a Python package** offering a simple workflow and methods for **dealing with biased data samples** when looking to infer from them to some population of interest.

Biased samples often occur in [survey statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_methodology) when respondents present [non-response bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_bias) or survey suffers from [sampling bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias) (that are not [missing completely at random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data#Missing_completely_at_random)).

An evaluation context for Rust.

This project consists of several related crates.

* [evcxr\_jupyter](evcxr_jupyter/README.md) - A Jupyter Kernel

* [evcxr\_repl](evcxr_repl/README.md) - A Rust REPL

* [evcxr](evcxr/README.md) - Common library shared by the above crates, may be useful for other
  purposes.

* [evcxr\_runtime](evcxr_runtime/README.md) - Functions and traits for interacting with Evcxr from
  libraries that users may use from Evcxr.
  
If you think you'd like a REPL, I'd definitely recommend checking out the Jupyter kernel. It's
pretty much a REPL experience, but in a web browser.

To see what it can do, it's probably best to start with a [tour of the Jupyter
kernel](evcxr_jupyter/samples/evcxr_jupyter_tour.ipynb). Github should allow you to preview this, or
you can load it from Jupyter Notebook and run it yourself.

# Transformer Reinforcement Learning X

trlX is a distributed training framework designed from the ground up to focus on fine-tuning large language models with reinforcement learning using either a provided reward function or a reward-labeled dataset.

Training support for 🤗 Hugging Face models is provided by [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/)-backed trainers, allowing users to fine-tune causal and T5-based language models of up to 20B parameters, such as `facebook/opt-6.7b`, `EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b`, and `google/flan-t5-xxl`. For models beyond 20B parameters, trlX provides [NVIDIA NeMo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo)-backed trainers that leverage efficient parallelism techniques to scale effectively.

The following RL algorithms are currently implemented:

| Algorithm                                                                     | Accelerate Trainer | NeMo Trainer  |

gpt3-wordpress-post-generator,A simple cli to generate WordPress posts using Gpt3 starting from a topic.,https://github.com/nicolaballotta/gpt3-wordpress-post-generator,2022-12-13T17:06:07Z,2023-10-28T05:05:36Z,Python,99,27,"# GPT3 WordPress Post Generator
This is a simple script I use to create posts for [NoHumansWrite](https://nohumanswrite.com) blog. It uses 
the OpenAI GPT-3 API to generate a WordPress post starting from the topic and tone 
of what you want to write.

![GPT3 WordPress Post Generator](screenshot.png)

It uses the [OpenAI Python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) to make the OpenAI api calls and the 
[WordPress XML-RPC library](https://github.com/maxcutler/python-wordpress-xmlrpc) to create WordPress posts.

At the moment this is a very rough implementation. I'm looking to improve it in the future and add more options to 
the script. Feel free to contribute if you find it useful.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the requirements: `poetry install`
3. Export the following variables:

    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=""Your OpenAI API Key""
    export WORDPRESS_URL=""Your WordPress xmlrpc URL""
    export WORDPRESS_USERNAME=""Your WordPress username""
    export WORDPRESS_PASSWORD=""Your WordPress password""
    ```
4. Run the script: `poetry run python cli.py --help`
5. Enjoy!

This library offers a simple real time visualisation of the execution of a Python program:

![demo](https://media.giphy.com/media/H7wUw65MLvHLoX4sMW/giphy.gif)

The numbers on the left are how many times each line has been hit. The bars show the lines that have been hit recently - longer bars mean more hits, lighter colours mean more recent.

Calls that are currently being executed are highlighted thanks to the [`executing`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/executing) library.

It also shows a live stacktrace:

![stacktrace](https://media.giphy.com/media/VIQqY8yyjYkhNfwF29/giphy.gif)

## Installation

`pip install --user heartrate`

Supports Python 3.5+.

## Usage

```python
import heartrate; heartrate.trace(browser=True)
```

This will:

 - Start tracing your program
 - Start a server in a thread
 - Open a browser window displaying the visualisation of the file where `trace()` was called.

In the file view, the stacktrace is at the bottom. In the stacktrace, you can click on stack entries for files that are being traced to open the visualisation for that file at that line.

This is a template for [Create React App Zero](https://github.com/jsebrech/create-react-app-zero),
an alternative to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) that requires no build tools and has no external dependencies. Check out the [demo app on github pages](https://jsebrech.github.io/create-react-app-zero/public/).

Feel free to fork and make it your own.

## Developing

There are no build tools required. All you need is a (static) web server and a text editor.

This app is entirely self-contained and does not rely on any external dependencies for running or developing beyond the browser, web server and text editor. This guarantees that no external change will break this app.

### Running

Run a local web server for the `public` folder and browse to `index.html`.

Examples of static web servers you can run:

- node: `npx serve public`
- php: `php -S localhost:8000 -t public`
- python: `python3 -m http.server 8000 --directory public`

When you make edits, save the file and reload in the browser.

ML/DL Math and Method notes


## Viewing Notes with LaTex Formulas properly rendered

Since github doesn't support JS, you will need to either download these files and view them in a markdown editor that support LaTeX or alternatively you can use some kind of browser extension that will get LaTeX formulas automatically rendered. You just install
the extension and when you browse any website with $\LaTeX$ in the html it'll automatically render it correctly.

* Chrome extensions:

   - [TeX All the Things](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tex-all-the-things/cbimabofgmfdkicghcadidpemeenbffn/related) 

If you know of good extensions for other browsers please send a PR or send me a note via the issues.

# nanoGPT

![nanoGPT](assets/nanogpt.jpg)

The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs. It is a rewrite of [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) that prioritizes teeth over education. Still under active development, but currently the file `train.py` reproduces GPT-2 (124M) on OpenWebText, running on a single 8XA100 40GB node in about 4 days of training. The code itself is plain and readable: `train.py` is a ~300-line boilerplate training loop and `model.py` a ~300-line GPT model definition, which can optionally load the GPT-2 weights from OpenAI. That's it.

![repro124m](assets/gpt2_124M_loss.png)

Because the code is so simple, it is very easy to hack to your needs, train new models from scratch, or finetune pretrained checkpoints (e.g. biggest one currently available as a starting point would be the GPT-2 1.3B model from OpenAI).

### [Demo Website](http://ankitsultana.com/researcher)

A clean, single column, monospace resume template built for jekyll

### Installation

Simply fork the repository and edit away.

#### Installation via remote themes

* Just setting `remote_theme: ankitsultana/researcher@gem` in `_config.yml` should work. Although in that case, I am not sure how
you would build your site locally for testing. If you know how, open up an issue and let me know.
* For more info, [refer this](https://blog.github.com/2017-11-29-use-any-theme-with-github-pages/).

### Customization

* You can edit the `.md` (markdown) files as you see fit. You can also add some other markdown file, say `foo.md` in the root directory of the repository. It will then be accessible like so `{{ url of your website }}/foo`.

* You can of course remove `contact.md` if you don't want it

* To set the heading, edit the `title` variable in `_config.yml`

* To edit the `links` mentioned on the navigation bar, you can edit `_config.yml`. For example:

```
nav:
 - name: ""About""
   link: ""/researcher/""
 - name: ""Resume""

>**We are modernizing the quantum katas experience.   Please visit https://quantum.microsoft.com/experience/quantum-katas to try the new online Azure Quantum katas experience, with integrated assistance from Copilot in Azure Quantum.** 

The Quantum Katas are a collection of self-paced tutorials and programming exercises to help you learn quantum computing and Q# programming.

Each kata is a separate set of exercises that includes:

* A sequence of tasks progressing from easy to hard.
  Each task requires you to fill in some code. The first task might require just one line, and the last one might require rather complicated code.
* A testing framework that sets up, runs, and validates your solutions.
  Each task is covered by a [unit test](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/test/getting-started-with-unit-testing) which initially fails. Once you write the code to make the test pass, you can move on to the next task.
* Links to quantum computing and Q# reference material you might need to solve the tasks.
* Hints, reference solutions and detailed explanations to help you if you're stuck.

*“李太白少时，梦所用之笔头上生花后天才赡逸，名闻天下。”——王仁裕《开元天宝遗事·梦笔头生花》*

[*TextBox 2.0: A Text Generation Library with Pre-trained Language Models*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13005)

TextBox 2.0 is an up-to-date text generation library based on Python and PyTorch focusing on building a unified and standardized pipeline for applying pre-trained language models to text generation:

- From a **task** perspective, we consider 13 common text generation tasks such as translation, story generation, and style transfer, and their corresponding 83 widely-used datasets. 
- From a **model** perspective, we incorporate 47 pre-trained language models/modules covering the categories of general, translation, Chinese, dialogue, controllable, distilled, prompting, and lightweight models (modules).
- From a **training** perspective, we support 4 pre-training objectives and 4 efficient and robust training strategies, such as distributed data parallel and efficient generation.

## FAQ

- Does this contain a model for inference?

There is no trained model. This is just the ship and overall map. We still need millions of dollars of compute + data to sail to the correct point in high dimensional parameter space. Even then, you need professional sailors (like Robin Rombach of Stable Diffusion fame) to actually guide the ship through turbulent times to that point.

## CIFAR10 hyperlightspeedbench
Welcome to the hyperlightspeedbench CIFAR-10 (HLB-CIFAR10) repo.

### How to Run


`git clone https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10 && cd hlb-CIFAR10 && python main.py`

Requires CUDA. Can be modified for other platforms with mild difficulty.

If you don't have torch and/or torchvision installed, please run:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` after cd-ing into the hlb-CIFAR10 folder, then `python main.py` instead.

If you're curious, this code is generally Colab friendly (in fact -- most of this was developed in Colab!). Just be sure to uncomment the reset block at the top of the code.


### Main

Goals: 

* minimalistic
* beginner-friendly
* torch- and python-idiomatic
* hackable 
* few external dependencies (currently only torch and torchvision)
* ~world-record single-GPU training time (this repo holds the current world record at ~<7 (!!!) seconds on an A100, down from ~18.1 seconds originally).
* <2 seconds",Machine Learning,"{'Problem 1': 'Achieving high accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset', 'Problem 2': 'Training a model quickly on a single GPU', 'Problem 3': 'Setting a new world speed record for CIFAR-10 classification'}","{

## Overview

ChatARKit is an experiment to see whether [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) can be harnessed to write code using custom user-defined APIs. You can speak a prompt asking ChatARKit to place objects of a certain type on nearby planes and perform some basic manipulations of their position, scale, and orientation. More interactions could readily be added. Here are some sample prompts to try:

- ""Place a cube on the nearest plane and make it spin.""
- ""Place a spinning cube on the floor.""
- ""Place a car on the table and make it drive back and forth along the surface.""
- ""Place a school bus on the nearest plane and then rotate it by 90 degrees.""

Full disclosure: the demo video represents some of the best results I got. Performance is generally worse.

## a summariser for youtube videos

ytsummary.py is a summariser for youtube videos. It uses the youtube API to get the video's transcript and then uses OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model to summarise the transcript.

You will require an api key for Open API. Sign up for one [here](https://openai.com/api/). Note that this will cost money, use it at your own risk.


### Usage

First install python (I used v3.10). Then set up a virtual environment and install the requirements using the setupvenv script:

Windows:
```
.\setupvenv.ps1
```

Linux / Mac:
```
. ./setupvenv.sh
```

Next, copy the file 'setcreds template.py' to 'setcreds.py' and fill in your OpenAI API key.

Now you can summarize a youtube video by running:

``` 
python ytsummary.py <youtube video url> --diagnostics --mentions

```

```
--diagnostics: outputs verbose information about the summarisation process

--mentions: outputs people and things mentioned in the video
```

### Example: Transcribing ""How close is nuclear fusion power?"" by Sabine Hossenfelder

```
python ytsummary.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ4W1g-6JiY

Prompt engineering is a relatively new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.

Motivated by the high interest in developing with LLMs, we have created this new prompt engineering guide that contains all the latest papers, learning guides, lectures, references, and tools related to prompt engineering for LLMs.

Happy Prompting!

# README

## Introduction

Welcome to **Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault 2023**! Thanks for checking it out.

What you'll see in this repo is a **highly opinionated, unapologetic** way to use [the knowledge base application Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Note that this is not the *only* way to use Obsidian, nor is it the *correct* way. But it is a way that **works well**, especially once you understand the [philosophies](#Philosophies) behind it.

Some of these techniques may be familiar to you, others may be novel due to the *idiosyncracies about how my own mind works*. I'll do my best to explain all of my philosophies and lived experience in the creation of this vault. Some techniques, processes and plugins are built into the platform. Other techniques leverage powerful external softwares to greatly enhance the Obsidian experience. I'll argue for those as they come as well as provide potential alternatives.

# 🐘🤘 Hydra

**Hydra is open source, column-oriented Postgres. You can query billions of rows instantly on Postgres without code changes. Parallelized analytics in minutes, not weeks.**

## 🚀 Quick start

Try the [Hydra Free Tier](https://dashboard.hydra.so/signup) to create a column-oriented Postgres instance. Then connect to it with your preferred Postgres client (psql, dbeaver, etc).

Alternatively, you can run Hydra [locally](#run-locally).

## 💪 Benchmarks - fastest Postgres aggregates on earth

Benchmarks were run on a c6a.4xlarge (16 vCPU, 32 GB RAM) with 500 GB of GP2 storage.
Results in seconds, smaller is better.

**PySnooper** is a poor man's debugger. If you've used Bash, it's like `set -x` for Python, except it's fancier.

Your story: You're trying to figure out why your Python code isn't doing what you think it should be doing. You'd love to use a full-fledged debugger with breakpoints and watches, but you can't be bothered to set one up right now.

You want to know which lines are running and which aren't, and what the values of the local variables are.

Most people would use `print` lines, in strategic locations, some of them showing the values of variables.

**PySnooper** lets you do the same, except instead of carefully crafting the right `print` lines, you just add one decorator line to the function you're interested in. You'll get a play-by-play log of your function, including which lines ran and   when, and exactly when local variables were changed.

What makes **PySnooper** stand out from all other code intelligence tools? You can use it in your shitty, sprawling enterprise codebase without having to do any setup.

Welcome to the ""Awesome ChatGPT Prompts"" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT.

Use ChatGPT to give helpful advice when your python program fails

# Usage

1. Install through git:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/fkhan0520/cgpt_exceptions
```
2. Create a `cgpt_exceptions_config.json` file with your OpenAI auth info and put it in the same directory as wherever `python` is invoked. It can use either your username/password or auth token. Full details in the [revChatGPT docs](https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT)

3. Just import the package and invoke your program as normal!
```python
import cgpt_exceptions
import os

def foo():
    os.listdir(""a-random-directory"")

foo()
```

```
Traceback (most recent call last)

## How to participate

Every time someone stars this repository, a new character joins the story. The story
is regenerated every 10 minutes.

The story code will use a hash of the username who starred the repository to generate a consistent random seed so each time the story re-generates, the characters and their attributes
remain the same. The story does not otherwise use any information about users
who interact with the repository.

If you have starred the repository and you un-star it, the character representing you
will disappear the next time the story is regenerated.

## What is a haxophone

A haxophone is an electronic musical instrument that resembles a saxophone.
It is designed to be an inexpensive and fully customizable travel saxophone.
You will never get the same expressiveness or depth of sound of a real
saxophone.  But with a haxophone you should be able to play alone or with
friends wherever you might be.  The mechanical keys and unique ergonomics give
it a different kind of sa",Music,"{'Problem 1': 'Creating electronic music with a saxophone-like instrument', 'Problem 2': 'Exploring new sounds and musical expressions in electronic music', 'Problem 3': 'Developing new musical interfaces and instruments'}","{

This is a simple visualisation of books on a bookshelf using some CSS transforms to give the effect of picking out the book when you hover over it.

I use it on my [personal site](https://petargyurov.com) to track what books I've read. It integrates nicely with static site generators, and well, just about anything since it's all vanilla JS, CSS and HTML.

![Example](https://i.imgur.com/6u0CySS.png)

**How do I add more books?**

A book is defined as follows:
```html
<div class=""book"">
    <div class=""side spine"">
        <span class=""spine-title""> Book Title </span>
        <span class=""spine-author""> PG </span>
    </div>
    <div class=""side top""></div>
    <div class=""side cover""></div>
</div>
```

Simply add this snippet for each book you want inside `<div class=""bookshelf"">`.

**Why use JS at all?**

I originally aimed for a no-JS implementation but there was no way of adding randomness to the book height, colours and patterns without it. You can of course remove the JS and implement that stuff manually.

**Is this free to use?**

Yep, do whatever you want with it.

Codex-CLI,CLI tool that uses Codex to turn natural language commands into their Bash/ZShell/PowerShell equivalents,https://github.com/microsoft/Codex-CLI,2022-02-14T22:03:52Z,2023-10-29T14:11:20Z,Python,1928,231,"# Codex CLI - Natural Language Command Line Interface

This project uses [GPT-3 Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) to convert natural language commands into commands in PowerShell, Z shell and Bash.

![Codex Cli GIF](codex_cli.gif)


The Command Line Interface (CLI) was the first major User Interface we used to interact with machines. It's incredibly powerful, you can do almost anything with a CLI, but it requires the user to express their intent extremely precisely. The user needs to _know the language of the computer_. 

With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly those that have been trained on code, it's possible to interact with a CLI using Natural Language (NL). In effect, these models understand natural language _and_ code well enough that they can translate from one to another. 

This project aims to offer a cross-shell NL->Code experience to allow users to interact with their favorite CLI using NL. The user enters a command, like ""what's my IP address"", hits `Ctrl + G` and gets a suggestion for a command idiomatic to the shell they're using.

This repository aggregates hundreds of popular Kubernetes CRDs (`CustomResourceDefinition`) in JSON schema format. These schemas can be used by various tools such as [Datree](https://github.com/datreeio/datree), [Kubeconform](https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform) and [Kubeval](https://github.com/instrumenta/kubeval), as an alternative to `kubectl --dry-run`, to perform validation on custom (and native) Kubernetes resources.  

Running Kubernetes schema validation checks helps apply the **""shift-left approach""** on machines **without** giving them access to your cluster (e.g. locally or on CI).

## How to use the schemas in the catalog

## 📢 Use Openblocks in 3 steps
1. Connect to any data sources or APIs.
2. Build UI with 50+ components.
3. Share with colleagues and customers.
## 💡 Why Openblocks
It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.

Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.

Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.

Openblocks wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Openblocks is

## Kill Kubernetes pods using Id's Doom!

The next level of chaos engineering is here! Kill pods inside your Kubernetes
cluster by shooting them in Doom!

This is a fork of the excellent
[gideonred/dockerdoomd](https://github.com/gideonred/dockerdoomd) using a
slightly modified Doom, forked from https://github.com/gideonred/dockerdoom,
which was forked from psdoom.

![DOOM](assets/doom.jpg)

## Running Locally

In order to run locally you will need to

1. Run the kubedoom container
2. Attach a VNC client to the appropriate port (5901)

### With Docker

Run `ghcr.io/storax/kubedoom:latest` with docker locally:

```console
$ docker run -p5901:5900 \
  --net=host \
  -v ~/.kube:/root/.kube \
  --rm -it --name kubedoom \
  ghcr.io/storax/kubedoom:latest
```

Optionally, if you set `-e NAMESPACE={your namespace}` you can limit Kubedoom to deleting pods in a single namespace

### With Podman

Run `ghcr.io/storax/kubedoom:latest` with podman locally:

```console
$ podman run -it -p5901:5900/tcp \
  -v ~/.kube:/tmp/.kube --security-opt label=disable \

Love Streamlit but:

- impossible to customise beyond PoC phase
- hard to reason about when extending and deploying
- non-standard approach doesn't play nicely with existing ecosystems

H-(html)-Stream is built with semantic html, FastApi and htmx to provide a fast and simple framework for rapid web app development that follows traditional frontend/server architecture (or at least follow it closer than Streamlit).

This is a step-by-step guide on how to become a DevOps engineer, with links to relevant learning resources.

## Disclaimer

> The purpose of this roadmap is to give you an idea about the landscape. The road map will guide you if you are confused about what to learn next, rather than encouraging you to pick what is hype and trendy. You should grow some understanding of why one tool would be better suited for some cases than the other and remember that hype and trendy do not always mean best suited for the job.

A python project template for educational purposes.

This project serves 2 purposes:
1. To be used as a base template for python projects
2. To help people understand the testing, linting, CI etc. python stack by **cloning/forking it and breaking it.**

## Quickstart
1. Create a python virtual environment:  
`python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate your environment:  
`source .venv/bin/activate`
3. If you want install the development requirements:  
`pip install -r requirements.dev.txt`
4. Install pre-commit to use pre-commit hooks:
`pre-commit install`
5. Install the package in development mode:  
`pip install -e .`

OR

1. `make environment`
2. `source .venv/bin/activate`

## Python venv
**venv** stands for virtual environment and is part of the python standard library (i.e. you don't have to install it).
Python virtual environments' role is to create an isolated python environment for each project so that there are no dependency issues etc. from conflicting project requirements (e.g. Project A need pandas 1.0 and Project B needs pandas 1.1).

### About

**redframes** (**re**ctangular **d**ata **frames**) is a general purpose data manipulation library that prioritizes syntax,  simplicity, and speed (to a solution). Importantly, the library is fully interoperable with [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas), compatible with [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), and works great with [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). 



### Install & Import

```sh
pip install redframes
```

```python
import redframes as rf
```



### Quickstart

This is a simple proof of concept that shows how you could use HTMX and Rust for frontend development. The basic idea in HTMX is that a webserver is being called on interactions with DOM elements, and returning back snippets of HTML that will replace certain DOM elements. Instead of http requests going to a regular web server, this project shows how service workers can intercept calls to a server and return back responses driven from WebAssembly instead.

See the demo here: https://richardanaya.github.io/wasm-service/

# Developing `wasm-service`

## Install & build

Install the WASM target via `rustup` in order to compile to wasm binaries:

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Compile the lib crate into `wasm_service.wasm`:

```sh
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

Copy the `.wasm` file to `app.wasm` in current dir:

```sh
cp target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/wasm_service.wasm app.wasm
```

## Serve repo root dir on localhost http

Use any method to serve the files from the root dir (in particular `index.js`, `sw.js`, and `app.wasm`).

Hello there! Welcome to the Goldfish Social repo, this project is intended as a free open source alternative to (former) Vine and (currently) TikTok. The project has just started and is in very early stages. We started out with something different, but after some great advice restarted the project in SPA form(Single Page Application). We are using the following stacks:

- [Laravel 9.x](https://laravel.com/).
- [Vue JS 3.x](https://vuejs.org/).
- [Tailwind CSS 2.x](https://tailwindcss.com/).
- [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/).


If you want to test out this software for yourself, do checkout our little [documentation](/docs/install.md).


## Features

As said, the project is in very early stages, and we will update the repo as soon as the code is available and tested. For now, we are building a full-featured social platform and later add Federation through [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).

We would like to extend our thanks to the following sponsors for funding Laravel development.

vim-markdown-composer,An asynchronous markdown preview plugin for Vim and Neovim.,https://github.com/euclio/vim-markdown-composer,2015-07-28T04:45:03Z,2023-10-15T02:47:03Z,Rust,608,26,"# vim-markdown-composer

![](https://github.com/euclio/vim-markdown-composer/workflows/Continuous%20integration/badge.svg)

vim-markdown-composer is a plugin that adds asynchronous Markdown preview to
[Neovim] and [Vim].

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZtyjjRD.gif)

By default, vim-markdown-composer uses a blazing-fast CommonMark (and
GitHub)-compliant renderer. However, it can be configured to use any external
program for rendering, such as `pandoc`.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Neovim or Vim 8. If you are using an OS with Vim
pre-installed, the system Vim might be too old (see `vim --version`).

This plugin supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.

In addition to Neovim or Vim, vim-markdown-composer requires a distribution of
[Rust] with `cargo`. Check out the [Rust installation guide].

vim-markdown-composer officially targets the latest version of [stable Rust].

## Installation

Use whatever plugin manager you like. If you aren't familiar with plugin
managers, I recommend [vim-plug].

### vim-plug

Here's an example of managing installation with vim-plug:

```vim

# Notational FZF

***Loosen the mental blockages to recording information. Scrape away the
tartar of convention that handicaps its retrieval.***

--- [Notational Velocity home page](http://notational.net/)

Notational Velocity is a note-taking app where searching for a note and
creating one are the same operation.

You search for a query, and if no note matches, it creates a new note
with that query as the title.

## Usage

## Changes

Read `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Description

Vim is great for writing. But it isn't optimized for note-taking, where
you often create lots of little notes and frequently change larger notes
in a separate directory from the one you're working in. For years I used

![logo](http://lisperati.com/webfui/logo.png)

## Philosophy of WebFUI

The goal of WebFUI is to let you do client-side Web programming in ClojureScript without having to ever deal with the DOM. Instead, all DOM is generated in realtime from a Clojure atom that contains just ""plain old data"" (called [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) in Clojure.) This ""DOM EDN"" is kept synchronized with a state atom that also contains EDN, where all the state for your program is kept.

You, the programmer, is only responsible for providing the functions shown in red in the picture below:

![graph](http://lisperati.com/webfui/graph.png)

These functions in red can be written 100% in the functional style, which is one of the benefits of WebFUI. Also, having EDN as the arguments/results for all your app functions makes debugging/unit testing extremely easy. Finally, WebFUI code is extremely succinct- [This fully-featured calculator app](http://lisperati.com/webfui/calculator.html) consists of [only 92 lines of code](https://github.com/drcode/webfui/blob/m",Web Development,"{'Problem1': 'Build interactive web applications using ClojureScript', 'Problem2': 'Simplify front-end development with a client-side web framework', 'Problem3': 'Utilize functional programming for web application development'}","{""Category"": ""Web Development"", ""Problems"": {""Problem1"": ""Build interactive web applications using ClojureScript"", ""Problem2"": ""Simplify front-end development with a client-side web framework"", ""Problem3"": ""Utilize functional programming for web application development""}}"

No vendor lock-in, which means that all the configuration for your applications/databases/etc are saved to your server. So if you decide to stop using Coolify (oh nooo), you could still manage your running resources. You just lose the automations and all the magic. 🪄️

For more information, take a look at our landing page [here](https://coolify.io).

> If you are looking for previous (v3) version, it is [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/tree/v3).

# Cloud

If you do not want to self-host Coolify, there is a paid cloud version available: https://app.coolify.io

You can easily attach your own servers, get all the automations, free email notifications, etc.

A tool for refurbishing and modernizing Python codebases.

## Example

```python
# main.py

for filename in [""file1.txt"", ""file2.txt""]:
    with open(filename) as f:
        contents = f.read()

    lines = contents.splitlines()

    for line in lines:

        for word in line.split():
            print(f""[{word}]"", end="""")

        print("""")
```

Running:

```
$ refurb main.py
main.py:3:17 [FURB109]: Use `in (x, y, z)` instead of `in [x, y, z]`
main.py:4:5 [FURB101]: Use `y = Path(x).read_text()` instead of `with open(x, ...) as f: y = f.read()`
main.py:10:40 [FURB102]: Replace `x.startswith(y) or x.startswith(z)` with `x.startswith((y, z))`
main.py:16:9 [FURB105]: Use `print() instead of `print("""")`

## Installing

```
$ pipx install refurb
$ refurb file.py folder/

> **Note**
> Refurb must be ran on Python 3.10+, though it can check Python 3.7+ code by setting the `--python-version` flag.

This is an implementtaion of Google's [Dreambooth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242) with [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion). The original Dreambooth is based on [Imagen](https://imagen.research.google/) text-to-image model. However, neither the model nor the pre-trained weights of Imagen is available. To enable people to fine-tune a text-to-image model with a few examples, I implemented the idea of Dreambooth on Stable diffusion.

This code repository is based on that of [Textual Inversion](https://github.com/rinongal/textual_inversion). Note that Textual Inversion only optimizes word ebedding, while dreambooth fine-tunes the whole diffusion model.

The implementation makes minimum changes over the official codebase of Textual Inversion. In fact, due to lazyness, some components in Textual Inversion, such as the embedding manager, are not deleted, although they will never be used here.
## Update

Whisper is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.


## Approach

![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png)

A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification t",Speech Recognition,"{'Problem 1': 'Improving Accuracy of Speech Recognition', 'Problem 2': 'Handling Large-Scale Weak Supervision for Speech Recognition', 'Problem 3': 'Developing a Robust Speech Recognition System'}","{""Category"": ""Speech Recognition"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Improving Accuracy of Speech Recognition"", ""Problem 2"": ""Handling Large-Scale Weak Supervision for Speech Recognition"", ""Problem 3"": ""Developing a Robust Speech Recognition System""}}"

## How to run locally?
1. Install the dependencies (for example using `pip`). The dependencies include :
* `PyQt5`, `numpy`, `pytorch`, `Pillow`, `opencv-python`, `requests`, `flask`, `diffusers`, `transformers`, `protobuf`, `qasync`, `httpx`

Package versions given in ""requirements.txt"" may, depending on environment, need to be supplemented by:
- jinja2==2.10.1
- markupsafe==0.23.0

A complete primer on the whys and hows of todo.txt.

The first and most important rule of todo.txt:

> A single line in your todo.txt text file represents a single task.


## Why plain text?

Plain text is software and operating system agnostic. It's searchable, portable, lightweight, and easily manipulated. It's unstructured. It works when someone else's web server is down or your Outlook .PST file is corrupt. There's no exporting and importing, no databases or tags or flags or stars or prioritizing or _insert company name here_-induced rules on what you can and can't do with it.


## The 3 axes of an effective todo list

Using special notation in todo.txt, you can create a list that's sliceable by 3 key axes.


### Priority
Your todo list should be able to tell you what's the next most important thing for you to get done - either by project or by context or overall. You can optionally assign tasks a priority that'll bubble them up to the top of the list.

A command-line driven TODO list manager.

## SYNPOSIS

Terminal-Todo: Maintain a list of tasks with priorities. The tasklist is
resolved as follows:

- If a tasklist exists in $HOME it will be used,
- If a tasklist exists in $PWD, then it will be used instead of the
  tasklist in $HOME.
- If no tasklist is found, then one is created in $PWD.

To create a tasklist in $HOME, simply change directory to $HOME and run any
`todo` command.

Usage is as follows:

- `todo <command> [options]`
- `todo <command> [options] <command-arguments>`
- `todo [options] <command> <command-arguments>`
- `todo <command> <command-arguments> [options]`

## Commands

#### `createdb`
> Creates a new database in the current directory.

#### `list [-s column | --sorted-by-<column>] [-r | --reverse]`

> Display all tasks. The list can be sorted with ""--sort-by=`<column>`"" or ""-s
`<column>`"" where `<column>` is a column name. Use the option ""-r"" or
""--reverse"" to reverse the sort order.
> If no sort column is specified the list is sorted by the task IDs.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What?!**

A: The following quote best summarises this project:

> They were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.

**Q: Not but really, what's going on here?!**

A: Kubernetes exposes a robust API that is capable of streaming incremental updates. Google Spreadsheet can be scripted to read and write values, so the next logical step is to connect the two (also, [credit to this person](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/ftgo69/sheet_ops_managing",Infrastructure Management,"{'Problem 1': 'Provides a user-friendly interface for controlling a Kubernetes cluster', 'Problem 2': 'Enables easy management of Kubernetes resources using spreadsheet-like operations', 'Problem 3': 'Facilitates centralized control and configuration of a Kubernetes cluster'}","{""Category"": ""Infrastructure Management"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Provides a user-friendly interface for controlling a Kubernetes cluster"", ""Problem 2"": ""Enables easy management of Kubernetes resources using spreadsheet-like operations"", ""Problem 3"": ""Facilitates centralized control and configuration of a Kubernetes cluster""}}"

    <h1>BookmarkFS - the dumbest project i've ever made</h1>
</div>
Exploits the google chrome bookmark sync service to store files for free

# Installation and usage
1. Go to releases and download bookmarkfs.crx
2. Go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode
3. Drag and drop the .crx file into the extensions page


To upload a file, click on the icon for the extension and it will open up a page where you can upload, download, and delete files

# How does it work?
Every bookmark can contain a maximum of 9092 charaters before google refuses to sync them. Using base64 encoding, this means you can fit around 72kb into a single bookmark.
When you upload a file, it gets compressed using gzip, encoded into base64, split into multiple bookmarks, and stored into folders corresponding with the file name.

====================================================
__An aspirational DevOps and Container IDE Concept__

![GraphTerm Screencast](https://github.com/millerhooks/GraphTerm/raw/master/docs/images/DockerGraphTerminalScreencast.gif)

A concept for recording videos about docker containers that seems
to be turning into an IDE.

I don't really have time to maintain this, but people might like it.
It was spawned from a set of lessons on Docker I was trying to write
but never finished. That maybe I'll post one day if I clean it up.

This was not written to be used in production or as a remote
administration utility. It was made for educational screencast
production and as a proof of concept I have for a DevOps IDE. If
you do anything dumb with it like host it on your servers to the open internet,
you may experience problems. It is still just that, a proof of concept,
but people seem to like it so I'm sharing it. I know the code is uggo,
I would love it someone helped clean that up and finished the DevOps IDE and
gifted me a Tesla. If wishes were fishes, eh?

**Search Engine:** Quickly search through the millions of available RSS feeds.

**RESTful API:** Turns feed data into an awesome API. The API simplifies how you handle RSS, Atom, or JSON feeds. You can add and keep track of your favourite feed data with a simple, fast and clean REST API. All entries are enriched by Machine Learning and Semantic engines.


## Example

``` bash

curl 'https://<yourhost>/api/searches?q=news' | json_pp

## What's New (October, 2023)

We are pleased to announce that this repository (formerly known as Microsoft Recommenders, https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders), has joined the [Linux Foundation of AI and Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/) (LF AI & Data)! The new organization, `recommenders-team`, reflects this change.

We hope this move makes it easy for anyone to contribute! Our objective continues to be building an ecosystem and a community to sustain open source innovations and collaborations in recommendation systems. 

Now to access the repo, instead of going to https://github.com/microsoft/recommenders, you need to go to https://github.com/recommenders-team/recommenders.

# Welcome to Streamlit 👋

**A faster way to build and share data apps.**

Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It’s all Python, open-source, and free! And once you’ve created an app you can use our [Community Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to deploy, manage, and share your app.


## Installation

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
$ pip install streamlit
$ streamlit hello
```

If this opens our sweet _Streamlit Hello_ app in your browser, you're all set! If not, head over to [our docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started) for specific installs.

The app features a bunch of examples of what you can do with Streamlit. Jump to the [quickstart](#quickstart) section to understand how that all works.

## Installation and usage.

This project has 2 dependencies.

- `numpy` for the maths implementation and writing the algorithms
- `Scikit-learn` for the data generation and testing.
- `Matplotlib` for the plotting.
- `Pandas` for loading data.

**NOTE**: Do note that, Only `numpy` is used for the implementations. Others
help in the testing of code, and making it easy for us, instead of writing that
too from scratch.

You can install these using the command below!

```sh
# Linux or MacOS
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can run the files as following.

> Program is an embodiment of an algorithm. Algorithms works on information, programs works on data. - Donald Knuth.



This is the repository for [QuantumAlgorithms.org](https://quantumalgorithms.org). 

This webiste is meant to be a set of lecture notes for students in quantum algorithms and quantum machine learning. 
It will be updated regularly with new research material. The scope is to bridge the gap between introductory material in quantum computing and research-grade papers, standardize notation, and be an overview on the state of useful algorithms for quantum machine learning and information processing.



## How to contribute:

mlstacks,A series of Terraform based recipes to provision popular MLOps stacks on the cloud.,https://github.com/zenml-io/mlstacks,2022-06-29T07:53:31Z,2023-10-27T01:56:44Z,HCL,222,20,"# MLStacks: Deploy your MLOps infrastructure in minutes

## 🌰 In a nutshell: What is MLStacks?

[MLStacks](https://mlstacks.zenml.io) is a
[Python package](https://pypi.org/project/mlstacks/) that allows you to quickly
spin up MLOps infrastructure using Terraform. It is designed to be used with
[ZenML](https://zenml.io), but can be used with any MLOps tool or platform.

Simply write stack and component YAML specification files and deploy them using
the MLStacks CLI. MLStacks will take care of the rest. We currently support
modular MLOps stacks on AWS, GCP and K3D (for local use).

## 👷 Why We Built MLStacks

When we first created [ZenML](https://zenml.io) as an extensible MLOps framework
for creating portable, production-ready MLOps pipelines, we saw many of our
users having to deal with the pain of deploying infrastructure from scratch to
run these pipelines. The community consistently asked questions like:

## Introduction

The  [Congress.gov Application Programming Interface (API)](https://api.congress.gov/)  provides a method for Congress and the public to view, retrieve, and re-use machine-readable data from collections available on Congress.gov. This repository contains information on accessing and using the Congress.gov API, as well as documentation on available endpoints.

Within the Congress.gov API, responses are returned in XML or JSON formats. An `<api-root>` element will be visible for responses returned in XML.

For every request, three elements are returned:

- The **Request** element contains information about the API request itself. This includes the format and the `<contentType>`; this is essentially the information you might expect to see in a request header.
- The **Pagination** element contains a count of how many total data items are contained within the response, a URL containing the next page of results; and, if the offset is greater than 1, a URL containing the previous page of results.
- The **Data** element, the name of which changes depending on the endpoint utilized (i.e. ",Government,"{'Problem 1': 'Accessing legislative information', 'Problem 2': 'Retrieving information about members of Congress', 'Problem 3': 'Obtaining details about legislative activities'}","{""Category"": ""Government"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Accessing legislative information"", ""Problem 2"": ""Retrieving information about members of Congress"", ""Problem 3"": ""Obtaining details about legislative activities""}}"

## Content new organisation

This semester we have reorganised the didactic material.
In the first half of the semester we covered 3 topics, spanning two weeks, each followed by an assignment.
Moreover, each lecture had a corresponding practicum.

1. History, backpropagation, and gradient descent
2. Parameter sharing: recurrent and convolutional networks
3. Latent variable (LV) energy based models (EBMs)

Pay attention that we have redesigned the curriculum and lectures' content.
We've treated LV-EBM as a *basic* module, which to build upon.


## Enters the semester's second half

I thought I was going to repropose the same practica I've used during [NYU-DLSP20](https://github.com/Atcold/NYU-DLSP20), last year edition, just in different order.

But I couldn't.

Tensor-Puzzles,Solve puzzles. Improve your pytorch.,https://github.com/srush/Tensor-Puzzles,2022-04-12T14:45:18Z,2023-10-28T00:04:33Z,Jupyter Notebook,1309,107,"# Tensor Puzzles
- by [Sasha Rush](http://rush-nlp.com) - [srush_nlp](https://twitter.com/srush_nlp) (with Marcos Treviso)




When learning a tensor programming language like PyTorch or Numpy it
is tempting to rely on the standard library (or more honestly
StackOverflow) to find a magic function for everything.  But in
practice, the tensor language is extremely expressive, and you can
do most things from first principles and clever use of broadcasting.


This is a collection of 21 tensor puzzles. Like chess puzzles these are
not meant to simulate the complexity of a real program, but to practice
in a simplified environment. Each puzzle asks you to reimplement one
function in the NumPy standard library without magic. 


I recommend running in Colab. Click here and copy the notebook to get start.

Developers and Open Source authors now have many services offering free tiers, but finding them all takes time to make informed decisions.

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings with free developer tiers.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a grey line sometimes, so this is opinionated; please don't feel offended if I don't accept your contribution.

This list results from Pull Requests, reviews, ideas, and work done by 1100+ people. You can also help by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) to add more services or remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.

## How to setup locally

### Install dependencies

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create the Neo4j database with correct data

Go to [Neo4j's Sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/) and create a new project, select Movies under Pre Built Data. Go to `Connection details` and grab your credentials to add it to the following environment variable:

```shell
export NEO4J_BOLT_URL=bolt://neo4j:password@host-or-ip:port
```

Run migrations and create your superuser (for the admin, this is using an SQLite database)

```
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Run the server

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

Now you should be able to access http://localhost:8000 and play with the app.

## Using the Admin with the Sandbox Dataset

Since the Movies dataset in the sandbox is a toy dataset, we need to make some minor changes to get it to work with our Django Admin. 
Primarily, we need to add unique ids to our nodes so we can open their detail view:

Alpa is a system for training and serving large-scale neural networks.

Scaling neural networks to hundreds of billions of parameters has enabled dramatic breakthroughs such as GPT-3, but training and serving these large-scale neural networks require complicated distributed system techniques.
Alpa aims to automate large-scale distributed training and serving with just a few lines of code.

The key features of Alpa include:

Determined is an all-in-one deep learning platform, compatible with PyTorch and TensorFlow.

It takes care of:

- Distributed training for faster results.
- Hyperparameter tuning for obtaining the best models.
- Resource management for cutting cloud GPU costs.
- Experiment tracking for analysis and reproducibility.

# How Determined Works

The main components of Determined are the Python library, the command line interface (CLI), and the Web UI.

## Python Library
Use the Python library to make your existing PyTorch or Tensorflow code compatible with Determined. 

You can do this by organizing your code into one of the class-based APIs:

```python
from determined.pytorch import PyTorchTrial

class YourExperiment(PyTorchTrial):
  def __init__(self, context):
    ...
```

Or by using just the functions you want, via the Core API:

```python
import determined as det

with det.core.init() as core_context:
    ...
```

fauxpilot,FauxPilot - an open-source alternative to GitHub Copilot server,https://github.com/fauxpilot/fauxpilot,2022-08-03T02:14:22Z,2023-10-29T12:26:38Z,Python,13365,582,"
# FauxPilot

This is an attempt to build a locally hosted alternative to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/). It uses the [SalesForce CodeGen](https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen) models inside of NVIDIA's [Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server) with the [FasterTransformer backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/fastertransformer_backend/).

<p align=""right"">
  <img width=""50%"" align=""right"" src=""./img/fauxpilot.png"">
</p>

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

* Docker
* `docker compose` >= 1.28
* An NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability >= 6.0 and enough VRAM to run the model you want.
* [`nvidia-docker`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
* `curl` and `zstd` for downloading and unpacking the models.

Note that the VRAM requirements listed by `setup.sh` are *total* -- if you have multiple GPUs, you can split the model across them. So, if you have two NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPUs, you *should* be able to run the 6B model by putting half on each GPU.

![dark theme code example](./examples/penumbra_example_header.png)

# Penumbra

Penumbra is a mathematically balanced colour scheme constructed in a perceptually uniform colour space with base colours inspired by the shades of colour occurring in nature due to the light of the sun and the sky. It cleanly separates the perceptual properties of colours while optimally utilizing the available colour space of typical displays.

The nine base colours are (almost fully, see below) symmetric and used to build the main light and dark theme, drawing from differently sized accent colour palettes as necessary. Additionally, there are two variants of the dark theme with enhanced contrast, ideal for anyone with mild to moderate visual impairments. Due to the constraints of the design principles, they are even particularly *unsuitable* for people with colour vision deficiency.

The accent colour palettes also lend themselves to encoding quantitative information in data visualizations.

Plane is a **container orchestrator for ambitious browser-based applications**. Plane implements an architecture we call [session backends](https://driftingin.space/posts/session-lived-application-backends).

**tl;dr:** Plane lets you spin up instances of any HTTP-speaking container via an API. Plane assigns a unique subdomain to each instance, through which it proxies HTTPS/WebSocket connections. When all inbound connections to a container are dropped, Plane shuts it down. Plane is MIT-licensed and written in Rust.

SpatiaLite and friends - sqlite, geos, proj, rttopo - for node (sync API) and browser (async API).

[Here is a list](doc/spatialite_functions.md) of supported SpatiaLite SQL functions and [a list](doc/extensions_functions.md) of available SQLite extension functions/modules.

Comments, bug reports and suggestions are welcome! spl.js will remain beta at least until the release of SpatiaLite 5.1.0.

## Install

```bash
npm install spl.js
```

The library for browsers bundles both the WebWorker script and the wasm file (~ 4MB).

A minimal proj.db including EPSG codes for lon/lat to ""Web Mercator"" and UTM is embeded. Other PROJ files and the complete proj.db are available from the `dist/proj` folder.
If you like to use the full proj.db instead you need to mount it to `/proj/proj.db` and set the path with spatialite's `PROJ_SetDatabasePath`.

[Apparently](https://github.com/jvail/spl.js/issues/1) typescript has no option to switch between `main` and `browser` entrypoints in `package.json`. For typescript & browser development you need to import spl.js (async version) as

## :dart: About ##

Mlflow Does not have integration with model servers ( Ex: Seldon-core) for automated deployment of models when registered or promoted to different stages, Mlflow deployment controller tries to solve this problem. Mlflow deployment controller is a python based controller which periodically checks the state between mlflow and model server's CRDs in k8s and acts accordingly. Every stage in Mlflow needs a separate controller as in the real world we would have different clusters for each stage. you can configure the controller to manage the state for a certain stage based on the use case.

This framework allows software engineering managers to have meaningful conversations with their direct reports around the expectations of each position and how to plan for the next level in their career ladder.

Although the framework uses roles and levels that are somewhat standard in the US tech industry, every company is different. Please use the information provided as a baseline and feel free adjust it to your needs.

The framework relies heavily on radar charts to visually represent the different perspectives and expectations of a given position:

**A List of Big Models**

</div>

# Introduction

Welcome to BMList! We wish to use this list to show the recent trend of big models.

In BMList, we list models that:

1. Have at least 1 billion parameters;
2. Have been publicly released either by a paper, an artice or a piece of news.

If you find any typos or mistakes in this repo, please feel free to create issues or pull requests!


# What's New

* 2022/08/05 We have upgraded the multi-dimensional table, and now you can filter the records as you wish!

# Model Expo

**We maintain a [website](https://openbmb.github.io/BMList) to show statistics of big models from multiple perspectives.**

## Big Model List

We show all information of big models in a [multi-dimensional table](https://openbmb.github.io/BMList/list), in which you can easily classify models by organizations, languages, domains, etc.

## Big Model Gallery

We also host a gallery to present figures about big models. Currently, there are five figures, previewed below, and any ideas for new figures are welcomed!",Data Management,"['Identifying and organizing large models', 'Keeping track of big models in a centralized location', 'Providing a comprehensive list of big models for reference']","{

### AWS CLI

Although the [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) is a great resource to manage your AWS-powered services, it's **tough to remember usage** of:

* 70+ top-level commands
* 2000+ subcommands
* Countless command-specific options
* Resources such as instance tags and buckets

This package contains the source code of the React components for the [Cloudscape Design System](https://cloudscape.design/).

Cloudscape is an open source design system for building intuitive, engaging, and inclusive user experiences at scale. It consists of an extensive set of guidelines to create web applications, along with the design resources and front-end components to streamline implementation.

Cloudscape was built for and is used by [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) products and services. We created it in 2016 to improve the user experience across AWS web applications, and also to help teams implement those applications faster. Since then, we have continued enhancing the system based on customer feedback and research.

Components APIs and guidelines can be found in the [Components section of the Cloudscape website](https://cloudscape.design/components/).

scribe,A tool for building elaborate CI pipelines using a familiar programming language,https://github.com/grafana/scribe,2022-01-06T17:01:04Z,2023-10-03T21:00:17Z,Go,123,5,"# scribe

Scribe is a framework for [Dagger](https://github.com/dagger/dagger) for writing flexible CI pipelines in Go that have consistent behavior when ran locally or in a CI server.

Write your pipeline once, run it locally and produce the config for your CI provider from the same code.

## Status

This is still in beta. Expect breaking changes and incomplete features.

## Why?

With Scribe you can:

- Run pipelines locally for testing using [Dagger](https://github.com/dagger/dagger).
- Generate configurations for existing CI providers.
- Use tools like delve to debug your pipelines.
- Use Go features to make complex pipelines easier to develop and maintain.

## Why not only use Dagger?

Scribe internally uses Dagger to accomplish consistency. The promise of running the same thing locally that's ran in a CI service could not happen without it.

Scribe adds a few features on top of Dagger, like:
* Executing an anonymous function instead of a command.
* Generating a CI configuration from your pipeline code.

## Running Locally / testing

**Note**: For examples, please see the [demo](demo/) folder.

**Arquero** is a JavaScript library for query processing and transformation of array-backed data tables. Following the [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) and inspired by the design of [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), Arquero provides a fluent API for manipulating column-oriented data frames. Arquero supports a range of data transformation tasks, including filter, sample, aggregation, window, join, and reshaping operations.

* Fast: process data tables with million+ rows.
* Flexible: query over arrays, typed arrays, array-like objects, or [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) columns.
* Full-Featured: perform a variety of wrangling and analysis tasks.
* Extensible: add new column types or functions, including aggregate &amp; window operations.
* Lightweight: small size, minimal dependencies.

# rustlings 🦀❤️

</div>

Greetings and welcome to `rustlings`. This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!

_...looking for the old, web-based version of Rustlings? Try [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/rustlings-1)_

Alternatively, for a first-time Rust learner, there are several other resources:

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Rust, but a bit theoretical sometimes. You will be using this along with Rustlings!
- [Rust By Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) - Learn Rust by solving little exercises! It's almost like `rustlings`, but online

## Getting Started

_Note: If you're on MacOS, make sure you've installed Xcode and its developer tools by typing `xcode-select --install`._
_Note: If you're on Linux, make sure you've installed gcc. Deb: `sudo apt install gcc`. Yum: `sudo yum -y install gcc`._

You will need to have Rust installed. You can get it by visitin",Coding Practice,"['Improving Rust coding skills', 'Getting familiar with Rust syntax', 'Building confidence in reading and writing Rust code']","{""Category"": ""Coding Practice"", ""Problems"": [""Improving Rust coding skills"", ""Getting familiar with Rust syntax"", ""Building confidence in reading and writing Rust code""]}"

**Bayesian statistics** is an approach to inferential statistics based on Bayes' theorem,
where available knowledge about parameters in a statistical model is updated with the information in observed data.
The background knowledge is expressed as a prior distribution and combined with observational data in the form of a likelihood function to determine the posterior distribution.
The posterior can also be used for making predictions about future events.

**Bayesian statistics** is a departure from classical inferential statistics that prohibits probability statements about parameters and is based on asymptotically sampling infinite samples from a theoretical population and findin",Statistics,"{'Problem 1': 'Provides educational material for learning Bayesian statistics.', 'Problem 2': 'Offers code examples to facilitate understanding of Bayesian statistics.', 'Problem 3': 'Supports a full course on Bayesian statistics with slides and code.'}","{""Category"": ""Statistics"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Provides educational material for learning Bayesian statistics."", ""Problem 2"": ""Offers code examples to facilitate understanding of Bayesian statistics."", ""Problem 3"": ""Supports a full course on Bayesian statistics with slides and code.""}}"

The facets project contains two visualizations for understanding and analyzing machine learning datasets: Facets Overview and Facets Dive.

The visualizations are implemented as [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) web components, backed by [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) code and can be easily embedded into Jupyter notebooks or webpages.

Live demos of the visualizations can be found on the [Facets project description page](https://pair-code.github.io/facets/).

# bulk

Bulk is a quick developer tool to apply some bulk labels. Given a prepared dataset with 2d embeddings it can generate an interface that allows you to quickly add some bulk, albeit less precice, annotations.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1019791/215258797-080dec5b-daf4-4d5c-843e-31088abff557.mp4

## Features 

Bulk gives you annotation interfaces based on UMAP representations of embeddings. It offers an interface for text. 

![](images/bulk-text.png)

But it also features an image interface.

Joining the modern data stack with the modern ML stack

## Overview

As part our TDS series on MLOps, our [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-post-modern-stack-993ec3b044c1) shows how a _post-modern stack_ works, by deconstructing (see the pun?) our original [YDNABB](https://github.com/jacopotagliabue/you-dont-need-a-bigger-boat) repo into the few fundamental pieces owning the actual compute: a data warehouse for dataOps, and Metaflow on AWS for MLOps. A quick, high-level walk-through of the stack can be found in our intro video:

[![YouTube intro video](/images/youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kHDb-XGHtc)

As a use case, we pick a popular RecSys challenge, session-based recommendation: given the interactions between a shopper and some products in a browsing session, can we train a model to predic what the next interaction will be? The flow is powered by our open-source [Coveo Data Challenge dataset](https://github.com/coveooss/SIGIR-ecom-data-challenge) - as model, we train a vanilla LSTM, a model just complex enough to make good use of cloud computing.

[Merlin](https://ocaml.github.io/merlin/) is an editor service that provides modern IDE features for OCaml.

Emacs and Vim support is provided out-of-the-box. To get editor support with Merlin in
other editors, see [this](#other-editors).

Easy Installation With opam
===========================

If you have a working [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) installation, install Merlin running the following two commands in terminal:

```shell
opam install merlin
opam user-setup install
```

[opam-user-setup](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-user-setup) takes care of configuring Emacs and Vim to make best use of your current install. You can also [configure the editor](#editor-setup) yourself, if you prefer.

Manually Building and Installing Merlin
=======================================

Since version 4.0, Merlin's repository has a dedicated branch for each version of
OCaml, and the branch name consists of the concatenation of OCaml major versions
and minor versions. So, for instance, `OCaml 4.11.*` maps to branch `411`.

# Metaseq
A codebase for working with [Open Pre-trained Transformers](projects/OPT), originally forked from [fairseq](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq).


## Community Integrations

### Using OPT with 🤗 Transformers

The OPT 125M--66B models are now available in [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/releases/tag/v4.19.0). You can access them under the `facebook` organization on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook)

### Using OPT-175B with Alpa

The OPT 125M--175B models are now supported in the [Alpa project](https://alpa-projects.github.io/tutorials/opt_serving.html), which 
enables serving OPT-175B with more flexible parallelisms on older generations of GPUs, such as 40GB A100, V100, T4, M60, etc.

### Using OPT with Colossal-AI

The OPT models are now supported in the [Colossal-AI](https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI#OPT), which helps users to efficiently and quickly deploy OPT models training and inference, reducing large AI model budgets and scaling down the labor cost of learning and deployment.

### Using OPT with CTranslate2

This repository contains the code for replicating training and running our **Berkeley Crossword Solver** system. We also release pretrained models, precomputed FAISS embeddings, and a crossword clue-answer dataset.

Those interested in the Matt Ginsberg's Dr.Fill solver can find it on the `drfill` branch. After the victory at the 2021 ACPT, the original Dr.Fill was retired.  The Dr.Fill code is here primarily for archival purposes, and Matt Ginsberg is not in a position to provide assistance with it.

MLOps is an especially confusing landscape with [hundreds of tools available](https://huyenchip.com/2020/12/30/mlops-v2.html). This project helps to navigate the space of MLOps platforms.

Understanding MLOps platforms is complex. Platforms have their own specializations and there is no clear line between a tool (with a narrow focus) and a platform (which supports many ML lifecycle activities). The below (from [the Thoughtworks Guide to MLOps Platforms](https://www.thoughtworks.com/what-we-do/data-and-ai/cd4ml/guide-to-evaluating-mlops-platforms)) illustrates how some of the platforms specialize in particular areas (bottom) and others aim to cover the whole lifecycle with equal focus (top):

![MLOps Landscape Diagram](images/whitepaper_MLOps_Landscape.png)

Even platforms that have a similar scope have different concepts and strategies, making them hard to compare directly. This repository provides resources for evaluating MLOps platforms.

Repository for the MLops Meetup on the 24th November 2021 Model Monitoring: The Million Dollar Problem by Loka team.

In order, demos shown in the video are the following:

## 1. SageMaker Model Monitoring

Explains how you can train an ML model, generate a baseline (for comparison) and creating a quality monitoring job using SageMaker. This [Jupyter notebook](sagemaker_model_monitor_demo.ipynb) is intended to be executed in a SageMaker studio notebook instance.

## 2. Whylogs

Code serves an ML model locally using flask and how you can add observability to your model predictions using [whylogs](https://github.com/whylabs/whylogs) Python module. Video further explains how you can generate comparisons between data profiles using `whylabs` paid platform.

A _data profile_ is a set of summary statistics, so what is actually sent to platform are statistics of your data rather than your data itself.

After iterations of development and testing, deploying a well-fit machine learning model often feels like the final hurdle for an eager data science team. In practice, however, a trained model is never final, and this milestone marks just the beginnning of a new chapter in the ML lifecycle called production ML. This is because most machine learning models are static, but the world we live in is dynamically changing all the time. Changes in environmental conditions like these are referred to as _concept drift,_ and will cause the predictive performance of a model to degrade over time, eventually making it obsolete for the task it was initially intended to solve.

ImPlot is an immediate mode, GPU accelerated plotting library for [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). It aims to provide a first-class API that ImGui fans will love. ImPlot is well suited for visualizing program data in real-time or creating interactive plots, and requires minimal code to integrate. Just like ImGui, it does not burden the end user with GUI state management, avoids STL containers and C++ headers, and has no external dependencies except for ImGui itself.

Statistical Rethinking (2022 Edition)
===============

Instructor: Richard McElreath

Lectures: Uploaded <[Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN)> and pre-recorded, two per week

Discussion: Online, Fridays 3pm-4pm Central European Time

# Purpose

This course teaches data analysis, but it focuses on scientific models first. The unfortunate truth about data is that nothing much can be done with it, until we say what caused it. We will prioritize conceptual, causal models and precise questions about those models. We will use Bayesian data analysis to connect scientific models to evidence. And we will learn powerful computational tools for coping with high-dimension, imperfect data of the kind that biologists and social scientists face.

# Format

Online, flipped instruction. The lectures are pre-recorded. We'll meet online once a week for an hour to work through the solutions to the assigned problems.

We'll use the 2nd edition of my book, <[Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)>.

outputformat,Python library to decorate and beautify strings,https://github.com/delestro/outputformat,2021-12-20T13:47:26Z,2023-10-23T11:10:33Z,Python,262,11,"# outputformat
Python library to decorate and beautify your standard output 💖

![ouf_image_example](https://felipedelestro.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/ouf_intro.png)

## Installation
To get the latest version, simply use pip:

``` Python
pip install outputformat
```
There are **no dependencies**. 

`Python>=3.6` is needed, as it uses f strings.

## Basic usage

It is recommended to use `ouf` as shortcut for `outputformat`:

``` Python
import outputformat as ouf
```

Main functions are:
* `ouf.boxtitle`
* `ouf.linetitle`
* `ouf.bigtitle`
* `ouf.showlist`
* `ouf.bar`
* `ouf.barlist`

By default, functions `print` the result. You have the alternative to return a `string` instead, by passing the argument `return_str=True`  (nothing will be printed in this case).

## Showing titles
To decorate titles with a box around it, use `ouf.boxtitle`:
```Python
ouf.boxtitle(""Long title in a box"")
```
```
╭─────────────────────╮
│ Long title in a box │
╰─────────────────────╯
```

Boxes can have different styles:

There are plenty of other tutorials that will tell you how to do the equivalent of that for various programming tasks—this one won't help.

**THIS LIBRARY IS TOTALLY UNSUPPORTED. IT IS PROVIDED AS IS, AS AN EXAMPLE OF ONE WAY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM. MANY FEATURES WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT YOU WRITING YOUR OWN `config.py` FILE.**

If we want to understand neural networks, it's essential that we have effective ways of getting lots of information from the innards of those models into a readable form. Often, this will be a data visualization.

Unfortunately, there's an awkward mismatch between workflows for deep learning research and data visualization. The vast majority of deep learning research is done in Python, where sophisticated libraries make it easy to express neural networks and train them in distributed setups with hardware accelerators. Meanwhile, web standards (HTML/Javascript/CSS) provide a rich environment for data visualization. Trying to use Javascript to train models, or Python for data visualization, takes on a very significant handicap. One wants to use the best tools for each task. But simultaneously working in two ecosystems can also be very challenging.

This library is an attempt at bridging these ecosystems.

A basic example of how to create an authentication flow using Next.js, public key encryption, and an Ethereum or EVM compatible wallet that works on both desktop and mobile sites.

This project was inspired by [Rahat Chowdhury's](https://github.com/Rahat-ch) [ETH SSO workshop](https://github.com/Rahat-ch/eth-sso-workshop/tree/solution)

### How it works

Using React, ethers.js, Web3Modal, and WalletConnect, sign into an app and authenticate the user on the server, in our case using a Next.js SSR route, using either a browser wallet or a mobile wallet. This codebase also works on mobile devices, legeraging WalletConnect to connect to your mobile wallet of choice.

> this repo is archived. You can still use it except for the live demo links. 

[Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/) is an open source vector search engine with build-in vectorization and question answering modules. We imported the complete English language Wikipedia article dataset into a single Weaviate instance to conduct semantic search queries through the Wikipedia articles, besides this, we've made all the graph relations between the articles too. We have made the import scripts, pre-processed articles, and backup available so that you can run the complete setup yourself.

As Figure 1 illustrates, ColBERT relies on fine-grained **contextual late interaction**: it encodes each passage into a **matrix** of token-level embeddings (shown above in blue). Then at search time, it embeds every query into another matrix (shown in green) and efficiently finds passages that contextually match the query using scalable vector-similarity (`MaxSim`) operators.

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following four guidelines:

- From outline to detail
- From old to state-of-the-art
- from generic to specific areas
- focus on state-of-the-art

You will find many papers that are quite new but really worth reading.

I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.

## Abstract

Exploration of 2 interesting libraries designed to improve upon topic modelling. One is Top2Vec and the other is BERTopic.

Top2Vec makes use of 3 main ideas :

Jointly embedded document and word vectors
UMAP as a way of reducing the high dimensionality of the vectors in (1)
HDBSCAN as a way of clustering the document vectors
The n-closest word vectors to the resulting topic vector (which is the centroid of the dense clusters in step 3) are then the topic words describing that particular topic.

Top2Vec has the following advantages :

Automatically finds number of topics.
No stop word lists required.
No need for stemming/lemmatization.
Works on short text.
Creates jointly embedded topic, document, and word vectors.
Has search functions built-in.
Language agnostic if you use the doc2vec method
Top2Vec defaults to a doc2vec model for the embeddings, but you can also use universal sentence encoder or a sentence-transformer based model for embedding the vectors.

The author has a detailed wri",Natural Language Processing,"{'1': 'Document clustering for topic modelling', '2': 'Keyword extraction from text', '3': 'Semantic analysis for text classification'}","{""Category"": ""Natural Language Processing"", ""Problems"": {""1"": ""Document clustering for topic modelling"", ""2"": ""Keyword extraction from text"", ""3"": ""Semantic analysis for text classification""}}"

Top2Vec
======= 

Top2Vec is an algorithm for **topic modeling** and **semantic search**. It automatically detects topics present in text
and generates jointly embedded topic, document and word vectors. Once you train the Top2Vec model 
you can:
* Get number of detected topics.
* Get topics.
* Get topic sizes. 
* Get hierarchichal topics. 
* Search topics by keywords.
* Search documents by topic.
* Search documents by keywords.
* Find similar words.

This is the repository of the paper
""Unsupervised Graph-based Topic Modeling from Video Transcriptions""
by Jason Thies, Lukas Stappen, Gerhard Hagerer, Björn W. Schuller, and Georg Groh.

In this paper,  we aim at developing a topic extractor on video transcriptions. 
The model improves coherence by exploiting neural word embeddings through a graph-based clustering method. 
Unlike typical topic models, this approach works without knowing the true number of topics. 
Experimental results on the real-life multimodal dataset MuSe-CaR demonstrates that our approach extracts coherent and 
meaningful topics, outperforming baseline methods. 
Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate the generalisability of our approach on a pure text review dataset.

The Python scientific visualisation landscape is huge. It is composed of a myriad of tools, ranging from the most versatile and widely used down to the more specialised and confidential. Some of these tools are community based while others are developed by companies. Some are made specifically for the web, others are for the desktop only, some deal with 3D and large data, while others target flawless 2D rendering. In this landscape, Matplotlib has a very special place. It is a versatile and powerful library that allows you to design very high quality figures, suitable for scientific publishing. It also offers a simple and intuitive interface as well as an object oriented architecture that allows you to tweak anything within a figure. Finally, it can be used as a regular graphic library in order to design non‐scientific figures. This book is organized into four parts.

Notes from my presentation on Python packaging at PyGotham 2021

A more comprehensive version of these notes can be found on my blog: [How to build, test and publish an open source Python library](https://simonwillison.net/2021/Nov/4/publish-open-source-python-library/)

**There is a more modern way of doing this** using `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py`. This [tutorial on Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) from the PyPA shows how to do this in detail.

## Packaging a single module

I started out by creating a new `pids` package using [this code](https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/main/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py), which I have copied-and-pasted into several different projects over the years.

1. `mkdir pids && cd pids`
2. Create `pids.py` in that directory with the contents of [this file](https://github.com/CAVaccineInventory/vial/blob/main/vaccinate/core/baseconverter.py)
3. Create a new `setup.py` file in that folder containing the following:
    ```python
    from setuptools import setup

A simple Python application illustrating usage of the AWS SDK for Python (also
referred to as `boto3`).

## Requirements

This sample project depends on `boto3`, the AWS SDK for Python, and requires
Python 2.6.5+, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, or 3.5. You can install `boto3` using pip:

    pip install boto3

## Basic Configuration

You need to set up your AWS security credentials before the sample code is able
to connect to AWS. You can do this by creating a file named ""credentials"" at ~/.aws/ 
(`C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\` for Windows users) and saving the following lines in the file:

    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <your access key id>
    aws_secret_access_key = <your secret key>

See the [Security Credentials](http://aws.amazon.com/security-credentials) page
for more information on getting your keys. For more information on configuring `boto3`,
check out the Quickstart section in the [developer guide](https://boto3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html).

## Battle-tested React Native boilerplate

The culmination of over six years of constant React Native development, Ignite is the most popular React Native app boilerplate for both Expo and bare React Native.

This is the React Native boilerplate that the [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red) team uses on a day-to-day basis to build client apps. Developers who use Ignite report that it saves them two to four weeks of time on average off the beginning of their React Native project!

### The Challenge
The question we invite you to address is to estimate the delivery date of shipments of online purchases. 
The shipments come from a diverse set of sellers on eBay, ranging from people selling items from their 
households to large business sellers. The journey of a package from a seller to buyer is made up of 2 parts. 
The first part is the handling time, which covers the time taken by the seller to package the item until it 
is handed over to the carrier. The second part is the transit time, which is the time taken by the carrier 
to deliver the package.

## Lecturer: Dr. Christopher Rackauckas

Machine learning and scientific computing have previously lived in separate
worlds, with one focusing on training neural networks for applications like
image processing and the other solving partial differential equations defined
in climate models. However, a recently emerging discipline, called scientific
machine learning or physics-informed learning, has been bucking the trend by
integrating elements of machine learning into scientific computing workflows.
These recent advances enhance both the toolboxes of scientific computing and
machine learning practitioners by accelerating previous workflows and resulting
in data-efficient learning techniques (""machine learning with small data"").

This course will be a project-based dive into scientific machine learning,
directly going to the computational tools to learn how the practical aspects of
""doing"" scientific machine learning. Students will get hands-on experience

* delete bucket
* put object (via PUT, POST, multipart and chunked uploads are also supported)
* copy object
* get object
* delete object
* batch delete

Not supported features (these might be implemented later):
* authentication: s3proxy will accept any credentials without validity and signature checking
* bucket policy, ACL, versioning
* object ACL
* posix-incompatible key structure with file-based provider, for example keys `/some.dir/file.txt` and `/some.dir` in the same bucket

**For modularity purposes, this project has been split up into two new repositories:**

- Core: [https://github.com/Safari-Wallet/core](https://github.com/Safari-Wallet/core)
- UI: [https://github.com/Safari-Wallet/ui](https://github.com/Safari-Wallet/ui)

This is an experiment to see whether we can build a viable browser extension Ethereum wallet for Safari on macOS and especially iOS.

## Overview

A diagram might be useful, but basically the current plan/rundown is:

- The `window.ethereum` object (EIP-1193 JavaScript API) will be injected into each page. This way, the wallet will automatically work with all apps/dApps that support MetaMask.

- For the interface, the native Safari extension popover is used, in tandem with the [WebExtensions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions).

The bulk of the development is currently going on in the `Shared (App and Extension)` and `Shared (App)` folders.

If you find the code useful, please star the repository.  
  
If you are completely unfamiliar with loading datasets in PyTorch using `torch.utils.data.Dataset` and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, I recommend
getting familiar with these first through [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/data_loading_tutorial.html) or 
[this](https://github.com/utkuozbulak/pytorch-custom-dataset-examples). 

### In a Nutshell
Video-Dataset-Loading-Pytorch provides the lowest entry barrier for setting up deep learning training loops on video data. It makes working with video datasets easy and accessible (also efficient!). It only requires you to have your video dataset in a certain format on disk and takes care of the rest. No complicated dependencies and it supports native Torchvision video data augmentation.

# Trust for Data-in-Motion

Ockam is a suite of open source programming libraries and command line tools to
orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential
management, and authorization policy enforcement – at massive scale.

Modern applications are distributed and have an unwieldy number of
interconnections that must trustfully exchange data. To trust data-in-motion,
applications need end-to-end guarantees of data authenticity, integrity, and
confidentiality. To be private and secure by-design, applications must have
granular control over every trust and access decision. Ockam allows you to add
these controls and guarantees to any application.

## Quick Start

Let's build a solution for a very common secure communication topology that
applies to many real world use cases. We'll build our first example using
[Ockam Command](https://docs.ockam.io/reference/command) but it is just as easy
to build e",Security,"['Implementing end-to-end encryption between distributed applications', 'Managing cryptographic identities', 'Enforcing mutual authentication', 'Defining and enforcing authorization policies at massive scale']","{

## Why Docker

""With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues’ OS X and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.

Developers can get going quickly by starting with one of the 13,000+ apps available on Docker Hub.

**Portainer Community Edition** is a lightweight service delivery platform for containerized applications that can be used to manage Docker, Swarm, Kubernetes and ACI environments. It is designed to be as simple to deploy as it is to use. The application allows you to manage all your orchestrator resources (containers, images, volumes, networks and more) through a ‘smart’ GUI and/or an extensive API.

Portainer consists of a single container that can run on any cluster. It can be deployed as a Linux container or a Windows native container.

**Portainer Business Edition** builds on the open-source base and includes a range of advanced features and functions (like RBAC and Support) that are specific to the needs of business users.

## A complete guide to start and improve in machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) in 2023 without ANY background in the field and stay up-to-date with the latest news and state-of-the-art techniques!

This guide is intended for anyone having zero or a small background in programming, maths, and machine learning. There is no specific order to follow, but a classic path would be from top to bottom. If you don't like reading books, skip it, if you don't want to follow an online course, you can skip it as well. There is not a single way to become a machine learning expert and with motivation, you can absolutely achieve it.

All resources listed here are free, except some online courses and books, which are certainly recommended for a better understanding, but it is definitely possible to become an expert without them, with a little more time spent on online readings, videos and practice. When it comes to paying courses, the links in this guide are affiliated links.

## Why annotated papers?

Do you love reading research papers? Or do you want to read more research papers but find them intimidating? Or are you looking for annotated research papers that are much easier to understand?

If you are in any of the categories listed above, then you have arrived at the right place.  I spend a lot of time reading papers. It is a crucial part of my ML work. If you want to do research or you want to be a better ML engineer, then you should read papers. This habit of reading papers will help you to remain updated with the field. 
 
**Note:** I am a pen-paper guy. Nothing beats the pen-paper reading experience, but in the ongoing scenarios (pandemic, lockdown, etc.), I am not able to print the papers. Taking this as an opportunity to share my thought process, I will be sharing the annotated research papers in this repo. 
**The order of the papers won't strictly be according to the timeline on arXiv. Sometimes I put a paper on hold and read it after a while.**

In this workshop, participants will learn how to load and store financial data on AWS from AWS Data Exchange and other external data sources and how to build and backtest algorithmic trading strategies with Amazon SageMaker that use technical indicators and advanced machine learning models.

![chart](assets/chart.png)

_Time Commitment Expectation: This workshop was created to be completed in approximately 1h 30 min._

## Regions

This workshop has been tested in **us-east-1**.

## Considerations for Each Role
As the team lead on this lean team of one, you'll need to wear multiple hats.  Below are some things we'll cover from the perspective of each role:
* Data Engineer - You'll modify scripts to load external market data to AWS.
* Data Scientist - You'll need to load the data into your machine learning development environment. Once loaded, you'll understand the data, use a machine learning algorithm to train the model and do predictions.
* Trader - You will use different trading strategies based on data to maximize Profit & Loss while attributing to Risk.

# Agoora agents

This repository contains all the open source Agoora agents developed by SPOUD AG. An agent is a piece of software that
scrapes a dataset (a database, a streaming platform, an API, …) and reports insights into Agoora. There are two 
types of data: meta data and profile data. The meta data is everything but the actual data. The profiles can contain

Currently focusing on performing Moving Averages on Streaming Market Stock data, but this framework is generally extendable for any Data Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering tasks.

@author: Sudheer Palyam


### Problem Statement
    Design and implement a Scalable, Distributed, Complete solution accepting input data feed and perform ***moving averages*** which helps identifying trends in Stock Market.

#### Technologies chosen:  Apache Spark 2.3, Scala 2.11, SBT 1.0, Kafka 2.0.0, Zookeeper

### Analysis of Structured Streaming Sliding Window based Rolling Average Aggregates:

As we can see in the output above, Kafka is fed with one message per second (just to demonstrate a slow stream).
Spark streaming is set to **3 seconds window**, **sliding every second**.
So there will be three messages in each window.
Since we are grouping by StockName, in this case AGL. There were two AGL stocks in one sliding window and its aggregates like max, min and avg are computed.
So we can observe how Spark Structured Streaming ",Big Data Analytics,"['Real-time stock trade analytics', 'Processing large volume of stock trade data', 'Leveraging Spark Structured Stream Processing']","{""Category"": ""Big Data Analytics"", ""Problems"": [""Real-time stock trade analytics"", ""Processing large volume of stock trade data"", ""Leveraging Spark Structured Stream Processing""]}"

*Florian Mair, Solutions Architect*

Data is ubiquitous in businesses today, and the volume and speed of
incoming data are constantly increasing. To derive insights from data,
it's essential to deliver it to a data lake or a data store and analyze
it. Real-time or near-real-time data delivery can be cost prohibitive,
therefore an efficient architecture is key for processing, and becomes
more essential with growing data volume and velocity.

In this post, we show you how to build a scalable producer and consumer
application for [Amazon Kinesis Data
Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html)
running on [AWS
Fargate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html).
Kinesis Data Streams is a fully managed and scalable data stream that
enables you to ingest, buffer, and process data in real time. AWS
Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with

Kafka-ML is a framework to manage the pipeline of Tensorflow/Keras and PyTorch
(Ignite) machine learning (ML) models on Kubernetes. The pipeline allows the
design, training, and inference of ML models. The training and inference
datasets for the ML models can be fed through Apache Kafka, thus they can be
directly connected to data streams like the ones provided by the IoT.

ML models can be easily defined in the Web UI with no need for external
libraries and executions, providing an accessible tool for both experts and
non-experts on ML/AI.

## Description
This Binance trading bot analyses the changes in price across all coins on Binance and place trades on the most volatile ones. 
In addition to that, this Binance trading algorithm will also keep track of all the coins bought and sell them according to your specified Stop Loss and Take Profit.



The bot will listen to changes in price accross all coins on Binance. By default, we're only picking USDT pairs. We're excluding Margin (like BTCDOWNUSDT) and Fiat pairs

> Information below is an example and is all configurable

- The bot checks if the any coin has gone up by more than 3% in the last 5 minutes
- The bot will buy 100 USDT of the most volatile coins on Binance
- The bot will sell at 6% profit or 3% stop loss

Astra,Astra is a tool to find URLs and secrets inside a webpage/files,https://github.com/Sachin-v3rma/Astra,2021-05-22T07:57:15Z,2023-10-26T04:08:32Z,Python,207,31,"Astra finds urls, endpoints, aws buckets, api keys, tokens, etc from a given url/s. It combines the paths and endpoints with the given domain and
gives full URL. We can use it on js, html, etc files.
Astra uses asynchronous method to fetch URLs using python's aiohttp and asyncio.
Its a combination of linkfinder and secretfinder. Uses Regex's from linkfinder, secretfinder and nuclei templates. 
Although None of them worked exactly because python's regex r way different.
So basically everyone of them is modified by me.

# Installation
	git clone https://github.com/Sachin-v3rma/Astra && cd Astra
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Takes Input from stdin, so easy to use in automation.

Flags : 
	
	-ns --> No Secretfinder. Only find urls and endpoints. Also increases the speed.
	-t  --> Threads. Only increase if you have strong internet connection.

Example :	

	cat live_subdomains.txt | python3 Astra.py
	echo https://www.example.com | python3 Astra.py -ns |tee astra_urls.txt
	cat js_urls.txt | python3 Astra.py -t 20 | anew urls_secrets.txt

Output :

Pyodide is a Python distribution for the browser and Node.js based on WebAssembly.

## What is Pyodide?

Pyodide is a port of CPython to WebAssembly/[Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

Pyodide makes it possible to install and run Python packages in the browser with
[micropip](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/micropip-api.html). Any pure
Python package with a wheel available on PyPi is supported. Many packages with C
extensions have also been ported for use with Pyodide. These include many

This code works as a boilerplate for an AI based trading system with yfinance as data source and RobinHood or Alpaca as brokers. DO NOT USE IT FOR TRADING AS IT IS. Follow [the tutorial in Medium.](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-create-a-fully-automated-ai-based-trading-system-with-python-708503c1a907)

Since I plan to keep writing on this topic I'm moving the original boilerplate to the `original_boilerplate` folder - without removing anything. I'll keep the `ai-trading-system` folder polished and more production-ready.

Usage so far:

```
$ sudo dockerd
$ docker-compose up --build ai-trading-system
```

Stay tuned!

Finance Plotter, or finplot, is a performant library with a clean api to help you with your backtesting. It's
optionated with good defaults, so you can start doing your work without having to setup plots, colors, scales,
autoscaling, keybindings, handle panning+vertical zooming (which all non-finance libraries have problems with).
And best of all: it can show hundreds of thousands of datapoints without batting an eye.

The NeoRL repository contains datasets for training, tools for validation and corresponding environments for testing the trained policies. Current datasets are collected from three open-source environments, i.e., CityLearn, FinRL, IB, and three Gym-MuJoCo tasks. We use [SAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01290) to train on each of these domains, and then use policies around 25%, 50% and 75% of the highest episode return to generate three-level quality of datasets respectively for each task.

# Baselines

OpenAI Baselines is a set of high-quality implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.

These algorithms will make it easier for the research community to replicate, refine, and identify new ideas, and will create good baselines to build research on top of. Our DQN implementation and its variants are roughly on par with the scores in published papers. We expect they will be used as a base around which new ideas can be added, and as a tool for comparing a new approach against existing ones. 

## Prerequisites 
Baselines requires python3 (>=3.5) with the development headers. You'll also need system packages CMake, OpenMPI and zlib. Those can be installed as follows
### Ubuntu 
    
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cmake libopenmpi-dev python3-dev zlib1g-dev
```
    
### Mac OS X
Installation of system packages on Mac requires [Homebrew](https:",Reinforcement Learning,"{'Problem 1': 'Building and implementing high-quality reinforcement learning algorithms', 'Problem 2': 'Creating robust and reliable reinforcement learning agents', 'Problem 3': 'Facilitating benchmarking and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms'}","{""Category"": ""Reinforcement Learning"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Building and implementing high-quality reinforcement learning algorithms"", ""Problem 2"": ""Creating robust and reliable reinforcement learning agents"", ""Problem 3"": ""Facilitating benchmarking and comparison of reinforcement learning algorithms""}}"

## The data

I used data from two months worth of comments (August and September of 2018) - which contains ~38 millions `user <-> subreddit` records.

You can find original data by [following this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment/)

I computed Jaccard Similarity between subreddits, and then stored results into github pages. Repository [is available here](https://github.com/anvaka/sayit-data). Please let me know if you are curious to learn more about this or anything else - feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/anvaka) or via issues in this repository

When I first learned Python nearly 27 years ago, I was immediately
struck by how I could productively apply it to all sorts of messy work
projects. Fast-forward a decade and I found myself teaching others the
same fun.  The result of that teaching is this course--A no-nonsense
treatment of Python that has been actively taught to more than 400
in-person groups since 2007.  Traders, systems admins, astronomers,
tinkerers, and even a few hundred rocket scientists who used Python to
help land a rover on Mars--they've all taken this course. Now, I'm
pleased to make it available under a Creative Commons license--completely
free of spam, signups, and other nonsense. Enjoy!

# micrograd

![awww](puppy.jpg)

A tiny Autograd engine (with a bite! :)). Implements backpropagation (reverse-mode autodiff) over a dynamically built DAG and a small neural networks library on top of it with a PyTorch-like API. Both are tiny, with about 100 and 50 lines of code respectively. The DAG only operates over scalar values, so e.g. we chop up each neuron into all of its individual tiny adds and multiplies. However, this is enough to build up entire deep neural nets doing binary classification, as the demo notebook shows. Potentially useful for educational purposes.

### Installation

```bash
pip install micrograd
```

### Example usage

Below is a slightly contrived example showing a number of possible supported operations:

```python
from micrograd.engine import Value

a = Value(-4.0)
b = Value(2.0)
c = a + b
d = a * b + b**3
c += c + 1
c += 1 + c + (-a)
d += d * 2 + (b + a).relu()
d += 3 * d + (b - a).relu()
e = c - d
f = e**2
g = f / 2.0
g += 10.0 / f
print(f'{g.data:.4f}') # prints 24.7041, the outcome of this forward pass
g.backward()
print(f'{a.grad:.4f}') # prints 138.8338, i.e. the numeric",Machine Learning,"{'Problem 1': 'Efficiently compute gradients for scalar-valued functions', 'Problem 2': 'Build and train neural networks with a PyTorch-like API', 'Problem 3': 'Implement autograd functionality in a lightweight manner'}","{

Implementation of [ReBeL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13544), an algorithm that generalizes the paradigm of self-play reinforcement learning and search to imperfect-information games.
This repository contains implementation only for [Liar's Dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice) game.

## Installation

The recommended way to install ReBeL is via conda env.

First, clone and create the conda env:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/facebookresearch/rebel.git
cd rebel
conda create --yes -n rebel python=3.7
source activate rebel
```

Then, install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install cmake
```

Finally, compile the C++ part:

```bash
make
```

## Training a value net

Use the following command to train a value net with data generation placed on CPU:

```
python run.py --adhoc --cfg conf/c02_selfplay/liars_sp.yaml \
    env.num_dice=1 \
    env.num_faces=4 \
    env.subgame_params.use_cfr=true \
    selfplay.cpu_gen_threads=60
```

Final Project for COMS4995.

Our goal was to replicate Libratus from a 2017 article published in Science titled *Superhuman AI for heads-up no-limit poker: Libratus beats top professionals*, and supplementary materials.

Instead of building a poker bot for a full-sized HUNL Poker game, we scaled down to a Leduc game with 105 chips in the stack and 10-chip big and small blinds. With this we could also test against a Leduc implementation of DeepStack, a rival Poker AI from 2016, on GitHub.

NOTE: This is a work in progress.

## Walkthrough

This walkthrough assumes a Unix environment and Python 3.6.

### Dealer

Poker games are conducted through a server following the [ACPC Protocol](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/downloads/documents/protocols/protocol.pdf).  Essentially, the **dealer** acts as the server, to which two **players** connect to play a **game**. After cloning this repo, clone [DeepStack-Leduc](https://github.com/lifrordi/DeepStack-Leduc.git) which bundles together DeepStack and an ACPC server.

This repository contains code samples for my book on [""Neural Networks

The code is written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. Michal Daniel Dobrzanski
has a repository for Python 3
[here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35). I
will not be updating the current repository for Python 3

The program `src/network3.py` uses version 0.6 or 0.7 of the Theano
library.  It needs modification for compatibility with later versions
of the library.  I will not be making such modifications.

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add
new features. However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel
free to fork and modify the code.

pycfr,A python implementation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization for poker,https://github.com/tansey/pycfr,2013-03-18T18:40:16Z,2023-10-23T11:04:37Z,Python,269,70,"pyCFR
=====

A python implementation of Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) [1] for flop-style poker games like Texas Hold'em, Leduc, and Kuhn poker. The library currently implements vanilla CFR [1], Chance Sampling (CS) CFR [1,2], Outcome Sampling (CS) CFR [2], and Public Chance Sampling (PCS) CFR [3].

Note that this library is intended to automatically support relatively small games. It is written in pure python and is not optimized for speed nor memory usage. Full-scale Texas Hold'em will likely be too slow and too big to handle. You should use this library if you want to learn about CFR, you are doing research on toy problems, or you want to sanity check your implementation on a poker variant where no optimized code is publicly available.

Creating a game tree
--------------------
To generate a tree for a game, simply specify the rules of the game:

```python
from pokertrees import *
from pokergames import *
players = 2
deck = [Card(14,1),Card(13,2),Card(13,1),Card(12,1)]
rounds = [RoundInfo(holecards=1,boardcards=0,betsize=2,maxbets=[2,2]),RoundInfo(holecards=0,boardcards=1,betsize=4,maxbets=[2,2]",Machine Learning,"{'Problem 1': 'Optimizing decision-making in poker games', 'Problem 2': 'Training and improving poker-playing AI', 'Problem 3': 'Applying Counterfactual Regret Minimization to other strategic decision-making scenarios'}","{""Category"": ""Machine Learning"", ""Problems"": {""Problem 1"": ""Optimizing decision-making in poker games"", ""Problem 2"": ""Training and improving poker-playing AI"", ""Problem 3"": ""Applying Counterfactual Regret Minimization to other strategic decision-making scenarios""}}"

pokersolver is a poker hand solver and comparison tool written in Javascript. It was written for and is being used in production on [**CasinoRPG**](http://casinorpg.com), an HTML5 MMORPG that features Texas Hold'em as one of its main casino games. It is designed for use on either the client (browser) or the server (Node.js). This library is capable of:

* Evaluating a hand of up to 7 cards
* Calculating the score of the hand (0-9)
* Returning the name of the hand (Pair, Flush, etc)
* Returning a detailed description (Two Pair, A's & 8's)
* Comparing an array of hands and returning the winner(s)
* Identifying all cards involved in creating the winning hand
* Support for wilds and other game types
* Works in both the browser and Node.js

## Installation
```
npm install pokersolver
```

## Examples
#### Server Usage
```javascript
var Hand = require('pokersolver').Hand;
```

#### Browser Usage
```javascript
<script src=""/path/to/pokersolver.js""></script>
<script>
  var hand = Hand.solve(['...']);
  ...
</script>
```

Solve two hands and then determine the winner between the two of them.
